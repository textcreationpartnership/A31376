            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN this diſſatisfied <hi>Age</hi> not to be concerned in the throng of <hi>complaints</hi> were certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very much different from the <hi>Mode.</hi> Which eſteemed inconvenience many ſhun with an over-haſty pawn of their credits, taking up on truſt any thing, which the <hi>Vendi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties</hi> packeth on them. Whereas we may juſtly imagine the quieteſt dayes to be the moſt bleſſed, we ſtill ſee it to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant humour of men to tire out Life in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of thoſe things, which are onely matter of diſturbance, and by undervaluing care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs to condemn <hi>the things, which belong to their peace.</hi> And if any man judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this courſe prejudicial to them, who take it, ſhould with moſt inducing Arguments manifeſt their abuſe, he is commonly thought to be civily treated, if onely ſcorned <hi>as a good natur'd Fop,</hi> he be ſuffered to retire without farther injuries. Which ſort of Rudeneſs and Injuſtice hath indeed much of
<pb facs="tcp:95462:3"/> the <hi>Hectoring Bravado,</hi> though little of <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ſobriety,</hi> which contrarywiſe with a dignifying condeſcention embraceth the man, whoſe well-meaning counſels intend the welfare of thoſe, to whom they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. Some few indeed there are, whoſe reſolute folly abominateth change, yet will patiently and honourably receive thoſe, whoſe becalming Virtues and perſwaſions urge a compliance with men of the fineſt temper. For although they make their reaſon ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to their will; and in all things yeild to the guidance of fancy, yet they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Reaſon</hi> as a favoured Slave to ſpeak in the behalf of its friends, and for its ſake give them a protection from inſolence. Now where outrages on the one hand, and contempt on the other are only mitigated by the inconſiderable kindneſſes of a few courtly non Obſervers, time ſpent in endeavours of reducing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant tongues into the due order preſcribed by diſcretion may be thought as much abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by unreaſonable reproof as unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble clamours. For who will think him ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeaſonably, who ſpeaketh to no purpoſe, and moſt men will conclude that ſpoken to no purpoſe, which is not entertained. But when we conſider duty obliging us to a valiant reſiſtance of impietie growing potent, we may
<pb facs="tcp:95462:3"/> alſo remember that reaſonable perſwaſions may draw many out of the danger of the over flowing torrent, and confirm them in the obſervation of what is neceſſary for their ſafety. Where we have little hope of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ground, we may well think it meet to defend what we have in poſſeſſion. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hard hap hath fruſtrated many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attempts of regaining diverſe, who have revolted; yet we may not deſiſt through opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that affections once alienated from the truth are afterward neither malleable nor melting. Continued diligence may find ſome, who, being ſurprized through weakneſs, would gladly kiſs that hand, which ſhall be ſtretched forth for their reſcue, and devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thank that pitying <hi>Providence,</hi> which vouchſafed them the mercy of a Deliverer. And if we hereto adde that men of the moſt unbridled paſſions accounting reſtraint their debaſement, are ſometimes by their own ſtumblings caſt down, and that the wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Beaſts have been taken in a toyl, we may not let ſink our hopes of retracting ſome of thoſe, whoſe ſeemingly invincible obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy laboureth to depreſs them. And of others, whoſe rejecting what we bring towards a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction is not out of malice and contempt, we
<pb facs="tcp:95462:4"/> have undoubtedly leſs cauſe to deſpair. For the Fort is more than half won, where the Defendants think not the Aſſailants injurious; and who can ſuſpect but that reaſon muſt grow ſtronger by time, when it hath a faint or no oppoſition.</p>
            <p>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T whatſoever may be the probability of ſucceſs, the publique clamours and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable diſtractions demand each mans aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance towards the prevention of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ruine, which is indeed juſtly to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but that more from the Complainers than the miſchiefs complained of. The vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly noiſed dangers are certainly leaſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible; but the <hi>Magicians,</hi> who firſt raiſed theſe <hi>buſie Spirits,</hi> are the moſt dreaded evils, whoſe ill acquaintance with the moſt <hi>horrid Authors of miſery,</hi> giveth the greateſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitions of a ſubſequent calamity, when their <hi>famed care</hi> is concerned in the diſcovery of any thing, which may be called <hi>formidable.</hi> Nothing is more fatal than the <hi>ſymptomes</hi> they give of a <hi>declining State;</hi> to which, when they pretend to preſcribe <hi>health,</hi> their very <hi>breath</hi> proveth <hi>poyſonous,</hi> and their <hi>tongues, ſet on fire from hell,</hi> purifie all they call corrupt by a <hi>ſanctifying conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MANY not out of ignorance of their
<pb facs="tcp:95462:4"/> malitious nature, but for the furtherance of ſome petty deſigns, do promote or at leaſt countenance theſe as <hi>Men of rare abilities,</hi> imagining they can at pleaſure ſtifle <hi>the flames</hi> of their <hi>kindling</hi> when ever their intended <hi>miſchief</hi> is ready to break forth. But theſe muſt with a continual vigilance obſerve them, and peradventure may (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their nimble glances and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in watchfulneſs) have a cheat put upon them; and although they may in the beginning eſpy the evil, yet may by <hi>the ſlie Artiſts in deſtruction</hi> have either <hi>the buckets</hi> removed, or <hi>the water,</hi> wherewith the <hi>fire</hi> ſhould be <hi>quenched,</hi> diverted into contrary channels. So that for want of prevention, the enſuing induſtry may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. And ſurely nothing is more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous then <hi>the application of remedies,</hi> which the <hi>head ſtrong</hi> evil diſdaineth and the too late offers of <hi>help</hi> againſt an <hi>irriſiſtible fury,</hi> eſpecially from thoſe in whoſe power it was either to bind or cut off the <hi>hands,</hi> which firſt laid together <hi>the combuſtible Materials</hi> of which <hi>the prodigious Devourer</hi> was once but the <hi>ſmall</hi> and <hi>deſpiſed off-ſpring.</hi> And if God ſhould permit a ſucceſs to the mercileſs contrivances winked at through confidence of ſuppreſſion at will, <hi>the conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb facs="tcp:95462:5"/> infatuation,</hi> may be foreſeen to turn into <hi>frenzy,</hi> when they find themſelves <hi>over-reached,</hi> and <hi>maſtered</hi> by their <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> whoſe puniſhment they muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be merited by cloathing ſuch wicked and dangerous perſons in the garb of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and worth, that good men may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of caution, while their whatſoever propoſals may be effected. They who can call that ſweet, which is acquired by wicked mens aſſiſtance, have commonly a time to gratifie their ſervants labours by a forced ſubjection to that <hi>Tyranny,</hi> which had its <hi>Original</hi> from their own <hi>degenerous indulgence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OTHERS of the greateſt noiſe of <hi>tender Conſciences</hi> have put on the ſoft reſolutions of believing, that all which beareth that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, hath really what it pretendeth to, as if it were impoſſible for <hi>Satan to transform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an Angel of light,</hi> or that <hi>inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> and <hi>unchriſtian</hi> practices ſhould take their range under the reconciling names of tenderneſs and bowels of compaſſion. Yet <hi>experience</hi> as well as <hi>the moſt bleſſed au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> would otherwiſe inſtruct men of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different capacities, if they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to either. And it would certainly ſeem very ſtrange did not the commonneſs abate the wonder. Were men as ſcrupulous
<pb facs="tcp:95462:5"/> in <hi>worldly tranſactions</hi> as they labour to be thought in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> the moſt loud crying ſins would not paſs among them for ſpiritual graces, nor crimes of the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtain be admitted without ſelf examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>How can we do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God?</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Confugit interdum templi violator ad aras;</q>
            <p>And <hi>Innocency,</hi> which delighteth in being there proſtrate, is apt to miſtake <hi>the Crafty Hypocrite,</hi> for <hi>the Pious Adorer.</hi> And this being ſo frequent, all, who have care that <hi>Religion</hi> be not brought into contempt by theſe open affronts, which ſhe daily ſuſteineth, will endeavour that theſe CAINS, who offer ſacrifices as well as ABELL, may have <hi>markes ſet upon them,</hi> that <hi>Simplicity</hi> be not enſnared. The griefs undergone by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiction of theſe <hi>mens tender mercies,</hi> and our being brought under the wheel by the ſame ſubtleties at this day in uſe may well quicken our diligence; but much more will the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the ſpiritual captivity of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes drawn thereinto by <hi>the impoſtume of Conſcience.</hi> Which is of ſo high a concern,
<pb facs="tcp:95462:6"/> that (although our manifeſto's come from us almoſt as tartly as our vital drops, yet) the love of our Brethren forbiddeth us to ſpare the thoughts of particular convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, when their ſo imminent danger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth our aid. But we are not yet in danger that our reſiſtance will be unto blood, (if an abuſed lenity let not miſchief grow paſt the power of contradiction) nor indeed is there other fear than of ſome ill ſented breathings proceeding from theſe (ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not pure) ſouls, whoſe <hi>pretended inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> are very unſavoury upon each appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of diſguſt. But if all the mildneſs, which men of the moſt yielding diſpoſitions have ſhewn, could ever have ſweetned them, we might think it ſafeſt to decline the fury of their tongues by courting them into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions ſuiting with our demeanour. Which courſe hath, alas! continually proved ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, and open truth, now by the neceſſity of the times forced from us, cannot ſtir up more bitterneſs than that, wherewith they have alwayes repayed condeſcention and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. This hath in it nothing of <hi>tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> or <hi>conſcience,</hi> which certainly ſhould be cheriſhed in all, who endeavour to give it due ſatisfaction by appeals to its juſtice and obſervance of its candid directions. And
<pb facs="tcp:95462:6"/> as <hi>againſt ſuch there is no Law,</hi> ſo neither can they be repreſented as enemies to <hi>the publique weal;</hi> for their <hi>integrity</hi> deſireth the good of all men, and eſpecially doth their <hi>exemplary obedience</hi> labour the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of that <hi>Authority,</hi> to which they are ſubjected. Men truely revereing <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> are not known by impertinent cavils of every thing, which beareth not their new ſtamp, but are ſolicitous of being <hi>void of offence towards God and towards man,</hi> andeavouring the conſervation of <hi>Unity</hi> both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> which alone conduceth to the honour of <hi>God</hi> and profit of each other. There are no <hi>tender conſciencies,</hi> but ſuch as fear <hi>God</hi> and his diſpleaſure, <hi>for his ſake ſubmitting to every Ordinance of Man, whether of the King as Supream, or Governours ſet by him</hi> to preſcribe rules for the encreaſe of piety and ſuppreſſion of ſin.</p>
            <p>NOW looking about us and ſeeing with what dangers we are encompaſſed ariſing from other mens machinations and our own miſtakes and diſtractions, a ſeaſonable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion againſt theſe we muſt judge neceſſary, could it be obtained. For it ſeemeth herein lieth all the difficulty, where to find the <hi>Balm,</hi> that muſt heal our wounds, or that
<pb facs="tcp:95462:7"/> 
               <hi>Samaritane,</hi> who will bind them up. He muſt be a man of imcomparable judgement, who ſhall be able to effect this cure, and reſtore to all the body that unſoundneſs and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which the ſincereſt Members wiſh for. But the Body is not in ſo deſperate an eſtate by reaſon of the deepneſs of the ſores or their near approach to the vitals, as by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral affected members envy to the untaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and their refuſing their own health to to the ruine of the whole. This is a ſtrange kind of ſullenneſs and ill nature, which is by ſome forreign Spectators pitied, by others cheriſhed; neither of which are obſerved with that due care, which our deſired pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity requireth. If <hi>Conſcience</hi> were obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our evils would be ſoon over; for there is nothing in them, but what <hi>an unfeigned tenderneſs</hi> doth fully remedy. This we may mention, but cannot give; the diſtempered Parts muſt herein do their own work; and after faithful applications of what <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> preſcribeth <hi>God</hi> will undoubtedly give the unexpected bleſſing. But, alas! how fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs are our perſwaſions directed to the ſenſe, en there is no reſpect given to one ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within, whoſe <hi>Art</hi> is infallible and <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi> unqueſtionable? The <hi>Phyſitians</hi> skill is as inſignificant to them, who will not be whole, as to thoſe, who are bleſſed with the fulleſt
<pb facs="tcp:95462:7"/> enjoyment of health. We have in <hi>this mad Age</hi> a Generation of Men, who glory in the loathſome puniſhment of their debaucheries, as the grand-mark of their gentility. They are nothing unlike, who delight in other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperances ſeeing them alway accompanied with ſhame and miſery, and account the due reproaches thereof diſtinguiſhing honours. Now theſe would have others ſuch as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that in a generall corruption they might have the pre-eminence, who firſt taught their Brethren to be diſſolute, and were <hi>the famous Founders of impiety.</hi> Whereas it were more for their eaſe and reputation by renouncing folly to become temperate and religious, to live quietly and happily under a <hi>well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Government,</hi> yet they reflect upon the time paſt, and conſidering how their gall hath been ſtill moved by the juſt taxations of irreligion and injuſtice, they judge it better to put themſelves in a poſture of bearing any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved burthen, than by an acknowledgement and revocation of errour to wipe off thoſe foul blots, which their ill employment contracted. A true ſorrow ſatisfieth for all injuries, and the pardon it procureth maketb men innocent. Here if the <hi>guilty</hi> take <hi>ſanctuary,</hi> they will be prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from infamy &amp; danger, &amp; their chief joy will proceed from the ſatisfaction they will be
<pb facs="tcp:95462:8"/> able to give themſelves, when their bleſſed change hath baniſhed confounding imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and introduced into their minds a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival peace.</p>
            <p>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T the encouragements, of perſiſting in theſe exhortations, being few and ſmall, we muſt ſee whether there be not among our ſelves room large enough for reproofs and admonitions. And peradventure much of the evil we complain of in others may be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by our ſelves, when being ſtrictly bound to duty we ſtretch the bands and give our ſelves unwarrantable relaxations. There are found among thoſe, who affect <hi>the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable title of Loyalty,</hi> ſome whoſe tongues are too active and hands too ſlow; as if it were more juſtifiable for them then for <hi>the open enemy to do this diſhonour,</hi> or for <hi>a friend and familiar acquaintance to withdraw himſelf</hi> in time of need. I know not what reaſons may be urged for doing that, which ſo much contradicteth their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions; but ſure I am that as there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle affection to duty ſhewn in ſuch demeanor, ſo is it no contrivance of ſafety for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors or any others. It looketh ſo like to treachery, that every eye cannot diſcern the difference; and although (at leaſt pretenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) it was not ſo deſigned, yet hath not faild
<pb facs="tcp:95462:8"/> of its ill conſequences. Which they cannot but own to have experienced, if the ſhame of diſhonourable actions would permit an ingenuous confeſſion. And more we are like to ſuſtain, it being probably conjectured to be paſt our power to overcome ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheifes, which late miſcarriages have creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or if a future care and managery do prevail over them, that it muſt be the great work of ſome conſiderable time: So pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the publick good are even ſmall neglects of duty or exceſſes in behaviour.</p>
            <p>AND certainly all <hi>diſobedience</hi> is as much againſt <hi>Intereſt</hi> as <hi>duty;</hi> whence we find it ſo perpetually miſcarrying. If <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> injure their <hi>Prince,</hi> they muſt never think by ſo doing to benefit themſelves. And when they run in diviſion ſtaining their querulous notes to the higheſt key, what they ſeek and ſo mournfully lament as loſt is too too frequently not diſcerned although by them poſſeſſed. Which thing nevertheleſs mans inclination to evil maketh very uſual, and few men enjoy what they have, becauſe all preſent goods are nicknamed with reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful terms, and are indeed wanting to the diſcontented. Whoſe ſelf-vexation is alſo others mens diſeaſe and real miſeries attend their uneven motions, in whom the bleſſing
<pb facs="tcp:95462:9"/> of <hi>

                  </gap>rovidence</hi> make no compoſure. But if there be a want of ſomething neceſſary to the accompliſhment of our welfare, the abſence of one or more goods is a lighter inconvenience, than to be deprived of all. Our minds ſetled in <hi>Obedience,</hi> and our diligent <hi>ſervice of God</hi> accompanied with <hi>hope,</hi> have the way of ſupply of whatſoever our defects. <hi>God</hi> will ſooner for us, than we can for our ſelves order the courſe of worldly affairs. Our backs have been long galled with the vexatious <hi>burthens</hi> of <hi>tyrannical impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and are we not worſe than mad men, if we think the reception of more ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding will be our eaſe, or that their unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Scourges are to our ſores mollifying and healing? Nay, even thoſe who firſt move the Engines of Commotion, in hope of being Perpetual Commanders of thoſe Affections which they have ſo diſingaged from their <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi> and ſtability, are but <hi>inconſiderate Politicians,</hi> who cannot by the ſucceſſes of other men, judge what will prove to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſecurity, but are rendred diſcerning only by their own miſcarriages. All Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings muſt be anſwerable to their Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; if theſe be laid deceitfully (let the Builders proiect what they pleaſe) the other will be certainly ruinous.</p>

And to juſtifie his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations, he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the former; he revengeth <hi>the blood of</hi> Naboth <hi>in the portion of</hi> Jezreel, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no reſtauration; he cutteth off proud <hi>Jezebel,</hi> and her tyrannical Off-ſpring, and leaveth of wicked <hi>Ahabs</hi> Race <hi>none that piſſeth againſt the wall,</hi> avenging alſo <hi>the blood of the Lords Prophets</hi> upon <hi>the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of</hi> Baal, yet is by their <hi>Golden Beauty</hi> induced to a Proſtration before <hi>the Calves at</hi> Dan <hi>and</hi> Bethel. For ſhould the beguiled people be undeceived, and ſent <hi>up to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to worſhip,</hi> he ſuſpecteth the return of <hi>the revolted Tribes</hi> to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubjection to their <hi>lawful Prince,</hi> who may ſeek to purchaſe favour by the price of his head. Now beſides theſe dreadful and
<pb facs="tcp:95462:10"/> diſtracting evils paining the heart, and gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> Bowels, it is left naked to Forreign, not barely contempt, but ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zal; and while diſagreeing Factions are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coying the people into Parties, the vigilant <hi>eye</hi> of an <hi>ambitious Neighbour</hi> eſpieth his opportunity, and compoſeth the differences, by making the captivated Opponents draw together under his Subjugating Power.</p>
            <p>THE miſeries of both kinds may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by <hi>Chriſtian Meekneſs,</hi> more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acting than diſputing its duty. Let us then make a ſober and diligent enquiry how far, and where we went out of this way, that our quick return may be the more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to our ſelves, and we thereby made inſtrumental to the general good: Which no man can be, whoſe Eccentrick motions draw beſides the lines of <hi>Obedience.</hi> That we may be the more certainly proſperous, we muſt not too eagerly carry on Private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, nor have our thoughts totally fixed on our own advantage, becauſe ſuch over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſſed inclinations do moſt aſſuredly bring us to a ſtate much diſtant from that we aim at. And as they make us apt to miſcarry, ſo do they enable each diſappointment to wound our hearts, and yet blind us ſo, that we not ſeeing whence our miſeries proceed,
<pb facs="tcp:95462:10"/> do ravingly vent our paſſions, to the injury of the Innocent. We forge the weapons that will deſtroy us, yet when they begin Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ſee not the mark we ſet upon them, but blame other hands and cauſes. I would have each mans <hi>virtuous demeanour,</hi> and <hi>exemplary obedience,</hi> be his <hi>Fortune.</hi> None thrive better than they who dare be Juſt; nor can any add to their own or the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> glory and happineſs, but ſuch as abominate the founding them upon <hi>ill Principles.</hi> Theſe are the men who give Splendour and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment to a <hi>Nation,</hi> who judiciouſly ſerve their Great <hi>Maſter</hi> with a <hi>Zeal to God.

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Reflections on the late Times, ſhewing the benefit of ſuffering in a juſt cauſe.</head>
               <p>THAT, which too often happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in humane friendſhip, and is a grand cauſe of the diſſolution of thoſe ſacred ties, is a miſconſtruction of each others fidelity. <hi>Jealouſie</hi> over ballanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the truth when <hi>miſapprehenſion</hi> holdeth the ſcales; ſo cannot impartial <hi>Love</hi> have that reaſonable liberty to ſpeak it ſelfe, nor manifeſt its value truly great in adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>innocence and Veracity.</hi> This furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Aſſaulter</hi> of United affections were the leſs unexcuſable did it onely ſeek to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſouls and content with thoſe impious breaches, did not intermeddle with the <hi>Soul</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95462:13"/> and its <hi>primitive Founder, the moſt holy and juſt God.</hi> Thoſe faithful leagues, which works of amity might contract, <hi>God's</hi> goodneſs hath been pleaſed on his own part alway to make, and for himſelf to keep in righteouſneſs and truth. His <hi>VVill</hi> is covenant, inſtrument, obligation, and performance; neither is there in <hi>him</hi> any dificiency untill that our either ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy or diſtruſt have changed the divine property, and made <hi>the flaming ſword</hi> ſole regent in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Many, it is true, do think the diſcontinuance of a former to be a ſtop of all future bleſſings, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Senſe more than Reaſon, and with both more than Faith, the excellency of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Operations. To me nothing ſeems more ſtrange than that any Man ſhould be ſo ignorant of <hi>Gods love,</hi> as to preſume he knoweth the waies thereof, which are ſo myſterious and abſtruſe. We are capable of the knowledg of it no otherwiſe then by an unbyaſſed <hi>Faith,</hi> and a conſtantly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Hope;</hi> and if we may call this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the perfection thereof conſiſteth in not knowing. But if we needs will buſie our ſelves with the cauſes, and become laborious in the ſearch after Reaſons for that, which is above Reaſon, the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95462:13"/> (which by a devout ignorance was kept flaming like a glorious Lamp,) then endeth in an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> and ſoon vaniſheth not leaving ſmoke or ſmoother to expreſs what it was, or where it is. That <hi>God</hi> is good, is undeniable; that he cannot alter, is as true. What a confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding miſtake is then that in us, which would perſwade us, that the divine Graces muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny among themſelves; whereas it is mans ſeditious ſelf only breaketh ſquares, and forgetteth to be obedient? <hi>God</hi> never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted from works of Love and Mercy (the whole frame of nature upheld by his wiſdome and providence witneſſing as much) but maketh the ſmiles of proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty viſible in the darkeſt ſhades of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. And although the fond <hi>Elſe, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie,</hi> upbraid my ſtile, endeavouring from <hi>Natures</hi> homebred arguments to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it, yet do I promiſe to my ſelf that felicity as the beſt, which I ſee hovering over my head in the day, wherein I ſit covered with duſt and aſhes. In that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly billow, whoſe gaping jaws receive me with no other promiſes but of deſtruction, ſurely I ſeem (<hi>Jonas</hi> like) wrapt up and graciouſly hidden from the rage of a more tempeſtuous evil. It is not alway a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95462:14"/> thing to be under that which men call calamity. <hi>God</hi> knoweth it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe man will not know it, he convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that to <hi>Evil,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> giveth for <hi>good.</hi> In this it is, that we ſo much miſtake <hi>Gods Love</hi> and prejudice our ſelvs by a wrong acception of his moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deeds. If we confer with fleſh and blood the <hi>Love</hi> may be queſtionable, but how can fleſh and blood diſcern it, the influences thereof being ſupernatural? Yet while we will thus ſeem wiſe, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool our ſelves of the benefit of this <hi>Love,</hi> and cannot notwithſtanding in the leaſt manner quit our ſelves of that, which we call a burden intollerable, <hi>and truely</hi> render ſo, for want of a ſupporting faith. In this caſe is man too much burden to himſelf without addition; but additions continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aggravating he ſhall not want, ſo long as he continueth in it. <hi>God</hi> indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth <hi>affliction</hi> on thoſe, whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth for his higheſt favours, and maketh them quickening provocations of a reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible gratitude; and therefore doth he accordingly own the receiver, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver the gift. Where the gift is welcome, the giver is received with Joy. <hi>Go thy way</hi> then <hi>and as thou haſt believed ſo be unto thee.</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95462:14"/> Reſt confident in his <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>thy mourning ſhall be turned into dancing.</hi> Tears may be ſhed in vain; an ſo are all thoſe, which in their birth cannot anticipate joy. I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, if I weep, either weep for joy, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I reſolve not long to grieve.</p>
               <p>SURELY I think it better to laugh at ſorrow, then to ſorrow for laughter, becauſe I had rather have ſimplicity tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, then late gained experience to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a lawrel; although both are in their due places commendable. I ſpeak it to this purpoſe, that afflictions are giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en either for trial or puniſhment. In trials afflictions are but paſtimes, if truely uſed; in puniſhment the cauſe ſomewhat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth the ſtate at firſt, but the benefit is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent at laſt: and although we call them in both reſpects miſeries, yet our life here were but a miſery without them. Although we reſerve our ſelves never ſo warily from the Worlds illuſions, we are apt to ſtray; but theſe heighten our eare, duplicate our zeal, and add new fewel to the former ſtock. Through theſe chiefly have we the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of approbation here; without which the Devil and his agents will take their liberty to aſk, <hi>Do ye indeed ſerve God for nought? hath he not made an hedge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95462:15"/> you?</hi> In good truth, theſe hot trials of our <hi>Faith</hi> do moſt excellently well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us in this life untill we come to a better. Did this tranſitory life conſiſt of joys uninterrupted until its final ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, we ſhould befool our ſelves of the joys of the Eternity, for that dot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon theſe we ſhould entertain but cold and remiſs thoughts of any others. But tribulations endue us with intireſt purity, and when tried in theſe fires we come forth a refined mettal, which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the divine mould, and hath uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with <hi>God.</hi> And were it not that ſufferings ſent from <hi>God</hi> were for our good, and do (not only preſerve alive in us the ſparks of virtue, but alſo) blow up and encreaſe that warmth, which hath long been raked up in embers, and is ſcarce durable without the billowes of adverſity, how cometh it to paſs that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>God's</hi> choſen ſervants have ſet upon them the value of the higheſt favours? Indeed ſeeing how mightily theſe do work for the good, and how uſually they <hi>do reſt upon the lot of the righteous,</hi> holy men do rather ſuſpect themſelves, then applaud their condition for happy, if their life hath at no time any intermixture
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95462:15"/> of ſweet and bitter. Piety, united with a long proſperity, is ſuch a wonder in our earthly pilgrimage, that we may even thence be brought to fear that we enjoy the leſs of <hi>God,</hi> the more we enjoy of his temporal favours without intermiſſion or diſturbance. To joy in tribulations is not the meaneſt of <hi>joys,</hi> but is the foundation of <hi>joys</hi> truely parmanent, or rather the proper fountain of <hi>pleaſure</hi> ſolide and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</p>
               <p>NEITHER need we fear the <hi>World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> reproaches when their ſcoffes riſe up like a cloud deſigned to darken our day, and which menaceth our ſecurity in the bleſſed light of <hi>the Star of Jacob.</hi> If they diſdainfully aſk us, <hi>Where is now our God in whom we truſted?</hi> Let us become more and more confident in him, that he may be more and more viſible in us. In our trials theſe muſt bear a part, and are commonly reſervs to be ſent forth at laſt when other experiments fail. And although theſe clamorous miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheifs ſeem afar off leſs formidable, yet upon one and the other aſſault they make even ſtrength it ſelf ſometimes to yeild, often to retire. We are apt then to break forth into unmanly paſſions and fruſtrate our former labours for want of a diſcreet
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95462:16"/> ſilence at laſt: Or elſe when from ſmaller blaſts, contumelious words encreaſe to a general tempeſt, we forget to ſteer our courſe with the more care, and cowardly faint for fear. How perfectly have I ſeen ſome to act a <hi>Bedlam freak,</hi> becauſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of their beſt actions is by fame obſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? And then do malevolent Tongues feed the fury of this diſtemper by adding ſtill new cauſes. Others, how (Alaſs!) do they pine away, and, like men laid out for an eternal reſt, wholly compoſe themſelvs to their ſleepy revenge? As if they repaid the adverſe taunts with this ſilent torture of themſelves, they ſo languiſh into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that indeed, rather then like men prepared for the graves deſcent, you would think them ſome expreſs ſhew of a too too haſty reſurrection, when the bones ſtart up, and leave their covering of fleſh and ſkin, as yet not acceptable. But a middle way there is wherein he walketh, who hath ſomewhat of the courage of the former, ſomewhat of the ſilence of the later. Both ſo well mixed and tempered, that being made up of both, you would admire how a venerable diſcretion could be extracted from the extreams of madneſs and folly. The appearance of diſcontent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95462:16"/> and ſorrow in the <hi>injured</hi> (whether it tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulently becomes its own proclamation, or fondly repreſſeth words the more to expreſs grief) doth but create new plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in the <hi>Offender,</hi> and by continual aggravations of his adverſaries cares he heighteneth his own delights. A regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs enterment of ſuch unwelcome gueſts (as are <hi>Scoffes</hi> and <hi>Reproaches</hi>) ſooneſt wearieth them. If you would force them to depart, they ſtick cloſeſt; if you would fly from them, they follow after and fly faſter: onely let them not confound, and they are ſuddenly confounded. The beſt courſe is, fear them not, regard them not. Refrain words, they are ſpeechleſs; water them not with tears, they wither; ſpare anger, you puniſh them; ſpare vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, you cruſh them. Where is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of trial, if we will be either outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious or ſullen?

So is he glorified both in the faithful and unfaithful, in the <hi>devout Chriſtian,</hi> and the <hi>hypocritical Profeſſor.</hi> The one inflamed with <hi>perfect love, caſteth away fear,</hi> not knowing how to be diſtracted; the other, what he deceitfully entertained, is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted publickly as well as privately to ſee abuſed; That which the one embraceth, as being its own beſt reward, the other with contrary aims courteth, and for the ſame vilifieth and contemneth; The one prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the contemplative joys of Heaven before all things, the other delighteth in the ſurfeiting ſweets proper only to fleſh and blood; the one is for <hi>the gain of godlineſs,</hi> the other for <hi>the godlineſs of gain.</hi> And therefore this ſlippery Saint doth not ſtick upon occaſion to creep into a religious
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95462:19"/> dreſs, and to become conſtant to it ſo long as <hi>conſtancy</hi> may be miſtaken. But he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth himſelf, when he ſeeth that dreſs grow out of faſhion, and with a tongue equal to the loudeſt, condemneth the needleſs obſervations of holineſs. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not with his hopes or wiſhes to maintain the Doctrines of Obedience with an empty belly, or run barefoot to Heaven. He holdeth it far ſafer to <hi>curſe God to his face and live,</hi> than to ſing <hi>Allelujah's</hi> to him with an heart torn upon a rack, and even breathing its laſt. He cannot diſcern <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions</hi> glories among the tottered rags of beggary, nor its beauty from its defaced Palaces. Thus while he deemeth <hi>Religion</hi> ſuperfluous (becauſe forſooth not laden with ſuperfluities) he is driven down the ſame channel with the moſt violent diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Chriſtian peace;</hi> periſhing wretches with deſperate ſouls?</p>
               <p>TO FAITHFUL men (although ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering) here are Arguments of a reward, that <hi>God</hi> regardeth and ſeparateth them from the veſſels of wrath. His Mercy and Juſtice know no mean, but are applied in the eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of either puniſhment or reward without neglect. And thoſe, whom <hi>God</hi> ſo owneth, he aſſuredly therefore ſeparateth, that <hi>in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95462:20"/> bleſſing he may bleſs them, and in multiplying</hi> may make their ſeeds of glory to <hi>be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied as the Stars of Heaven, and as the ſand, which is upon the ſea-ſhore;</hi> giving them this preſent aſſurance, that though they ſuffer, <hi>yet a little while and the wicked ſhall no more be,</hi> although they be oppreſſed by them for a while, yet at length <hi>they ſhall poſſeſs the gates of their enemies.</hi> Let a fading beauty and decaying luſtre preſent fools with admiration; men ſoundly wiſe, and diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly politick, laugh at theſe Images of content. If they at all mourn, it is not at their own ſeeming calamities, but that any ſhould by ſuch happineſs dream themſelves into ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance and wo interminable. And as much do they wonder how ſuch men can ever hope to effect their deſigns. How little furious words, violence, and rage can wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Religions</hi> Nerves (although they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times force not only tears but blood) the miraculous growth of the <hi>primitive Church</hi> under perſecution may teach them. As we have ſeen a fire for ſome time ſtifled, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after flame up, and ſpread it ſelf into almoſt an incredible extent, waving its brandiſhed head with the ambition of reaching Heaven: So <hi>Religion</hi> threatned, confined and oppreſſed committeth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95462:20"/> on violence it ſelf, and maketh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion become its glory. They who would bereave the <hi>Church</hi> of her children, did but from each wound of theirs ſhed that blood, which generated anew. In the greateſt rage of perſecutions, that world was (in a ſort) too narrow for the reception of <hi>Faith</hi>'s <hi>numerous Iſſue,</hi> and therefore <hi>Heaven</hi> became a <hi>colony</hi> for thoſe many, who ſo willingly left earth out of confidence of an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance above. We ſee then that theſe adverſaries of our temporal proſperity (which too too frequently proveth the Souls canker) are not altogether inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient inſtruments. Their potions given us to drink, (though intended for miſchief,) become cordials and wholſome medicines; from <hi>Stygian</hi> in the gift, they become <hi>Elyſian</hi> in the receipt, and are properly ſaid to make us glad, becauſe once taſted they encourage us and cheriſh in us a certain generous ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity, which without ſuch contentions languiſheth and dyeth.</p>
               <p>NOW that we may not miſtake <hi>God</hi>'s love, neither commit a rape upon our own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, let us conſider that that life is not the beſt, which is, but which ſhall be free from trouble; that thoſe joys are not the moſt ſincere, which touch the ſenſe but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95462:21"/> the ſoul with delight. So then the only means to remove the injuries of ſuſpitious joys, is to make friendſhip with their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites. We muſt work our ſouls joy, not out of eaſe, which is but the gate of corruption; not out of worldly favour, which is but deceitful; not out of any ſettled affection upon other the like things, as doting upon wealth, content in pleaſure, an over-high value of our reputations among men. We may not by theſe think to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate to our ſelves benefit or bliſs; (they will make us at laſt come ſhort of our aim) but by a laborious care to fortifie both ſoul and body, by an earneſt endeavour to have <hi>God</hi>'s love; and all our trials not to be found of another temper than we were before willing to have them thought of, by dedicating the heart, which is the throne of love, to him alone, and ſo making poverty, reproach, and ſuch like (if he be pleaſed to appoint us thereto) our favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites and familiars. And thus ſhall we alſo make to our ſelves reparations for the loſs of other things, which I account but the injuries of mortality if courted and wooed.</p>
               <p>TRIBULATION is frequently extended to all mankind, but is a beneficial priviledge
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95462:21"/> only to the juſt. To them it becometh a benefit, becauſe they know how to prize it; but eſpecially becauſe they know how to uſe it: to others it is not ſo, for the contrary reaſon. The effects of it are according to each mans apprehenſion and eſteem of it; as trials they are good, if we be pleaſed to think ſo: as puniſhments alſo, opinion hath the ſame power to make them uſeful. Even in this reſpect there is in afflictions an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial love conſonant to all <hi>God</hi>'s favours. In them we cannot but acknowledge a divine power, making us <hi>learn obedience from the things we have ſuffered.</hi> Thereby the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> doth more effectually breath into us than by the Prophets and holy Scriptures themſelves. We too too frequently reſiſt thoſe ſacred dictates of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and vilifie the monitions of pious men: but afflictions render us not only attentive to <hi>God</hi> ſpeaking by them, but alſo yielding and obedient. To which man can hardly do other than ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, they being true mollifiers of the heart. They ſpeak unto us ſo powerfully, that we are ſure to anſwer in ſuch language as may witneſs an humiliation and change wrought in us. Indeed the language of ſome differeth from that of others. Therefore the repining <hi>Reprobate</hi> is clamorous, crying out, <hi>My
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95462:22"/> puniſhment is greater than I can bear;</hi> but he, who hath in him any thing ſavouring of piety, remembreth theſe puniſhments to be <hi>the chastiſements of his peace,</hi> and imploreth the divine mercy in laments and tears, the eruptions of a penitent heart. Puniſhments are for the better, until by the offender they are turned to the worſe. He, who <hi>correcteth every Son, whom he receiveth,</hi> correcteth many that none may be loſt. Neither will his rod ſeem troubleſome to any, whom the memory of their tranſgreſſions doth truly afflict. If ſin cauſe ſorrow, the reſt hath nothing of ſorrow, but is its remedy, which although it ſmelleth ſowre, its relliſh is ſweet. When any of us forgetteth to waſh his polluted breaſt with a deluge of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant tears, to that croſs (as we call it) or miſhap, which forceth him to pour out what to his own damage he wretchedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, he ought eſpecially to give a ready welcome. In the poſſeſſion of this very fortunate adverſity mortal man hath ſo much cauſe to rejoyce as inceſſantly to pray rather by miſery thus to be made happy, than to be in a poſſibility of miſtaking <hi>God</hi>'s love, through a tedious worldly proſperity. Could we live in the world without ſin, we needed not by one miſery to be wracked
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95462:22"/> out of another. But ſeeing we cannot but ſin, 'tis meet we ſhould bear the remedy; nay, becauſe we know it to be a remedy, rather invite it than refuſe it. A tree driven by an adverſe and violent wind, is better preſerved by a prop (although perhaps it rub off ſome of the bark, or for due pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſome ſmall regardleſs branch be lopt off) than be turned up to be deſtroyed root and branch: So if we could ſtand alway in that innocent poſture and holy order, which beſeemeth us, as there would be no need of it, ſo there would be undoubtedly an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity from tribulation. But ſeeing we either cannot or will not but incline that way, which corruption driveth us, let us ſtand as we may; better it is that part be impaired than all loſt. And if nought but ſuperfluities be impaired, ſuch impairing endeth in a bleſſed reparation. Loſing what we have commonly maketh us find our ſelves. Find our ſelves, I ſay: For it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happeneth that among our many ſtupendious toyes and glorious trifles, we ramble until we are at a loſs. We commit ſin and make daily progreſſes in it; ſin hath its deluding enticements, which we liſten to and follow; we follow ſo far till we forget our ſelves, we liſten till we are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95462:23"/> lulled aſleep. Thanks then and court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for that friendly hand, which, awakening and correcting us, pointeth out the way of our return. This hand is affliction, the merit (yet withal the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation) of ſin. We do not uſe to ſee Colliers with white faces: Mortals, as ſinners, have a ſmutty hue; and beſides that, the fruits of their works have a ſooty taſte. Uglineſs, bitterneſs, croſſes and perplexities come of conformity with things of nought. But yet it is for our good to have our ill diſpoſitions thwarted, which cannot more profitably be, than by <hi>God</hi>'s hand afflicting; which, although ſeemingly perplexing, is found conſolatory; for after due obſervation it will appear, that even the rod it holdeth and uſeth, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and delightſome. It frequently happeneth that we have heard ſome of our ungoverned actions rehearſed with addition by thoſe, whom we might truly imagine meant us no good, neither ſpake for our bettering. But ought we nevertheleſs fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to ſwell againſt, or paſſionately to expoſtulate with <hi>God,</hi> who ſuffered our enemies thus to triumph over us, when ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by infirmity? No, It is but our bounden <hi>Religion</hi> to thank that <hi>Fountain
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95462:23"/> of pity</hi> for ſo unexpected and moſt benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial help in the time of our greateſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. His careful love wrought in him a timely compaſſion towards us diſtreſſed, by whether natural or accidental pollutions; and to the end that we might not, to our <hi>Creator</hi>'s diſhonour and our own confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhame, lye long in them, out of enmities high flown rage did he find means to make a deſired reconciliation. Thoſe, whom we call friends (and have reaſon peradventure in other things ſo to eſteem them) will not ſo readily <hi>caſt theſe ſtones at us,</hi> either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering their own frailty, or overweighing the diſpleaſure many times proceeding from a juſt reprehenſion. But our enemies will freely diſperſe them without either fear or wearineſs. From whom our wiſe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ought quietly to take things of this nature, and acquaint our ſelves therewith as from the better hand. Other times (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably) we may be aſſaulted with violent ſhelves of accuſations concerning thoſe things, wherein without blinding ſelf flattery, we have judged our ſelves not ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religiouſly innocent. But then laying into the ſame ſcale actions of ancienter commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of the knowledge whereof our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries have been deprived, we ſhall find it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95462:24"/> beſt to put this bill with other accompts all upon the ſame file. Seeing we have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as much otherwiſe, without complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then may we hear ſomewhat of injury, ſeeing we had not been for a long time juſtly dealt with, nor ſo much as met with our own in a tedious diſcourſe. Who is there, that would exempt himſelf from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſufferers? Let him not bring inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency for his bail. Although he be in the next degree to that ſelf nobilifying perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which might take the pliant <hi>wings of the dove to fly away and be at reſt,</hi> yet that little, be it (as I may ſay) but a part of defect, ſo inſupportably cloggeth man, that he cannot advance himſelf above the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of mortality. Life upon earth is but a pawn depoſited in ſin-begotten miſeries griping hand. But if ſhe be able ſo to ſqueeze and temper us, that our outſide and inſide do at laſt become a lump all of good liking in the ſight of our good and gracious <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> we are neither fooliſhly to fear, nor curriſhly to ſnap at, that hand, which new mouldeth us. The place of this our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination may indeed ſeem <hi>dreadful,</hi> yet <hi>is it none other but the houſe of God, and the gate of heaven;</hi> it is the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of <hi>devout piety,</hi> whereinto we make our ſubtil, and

Let him (as he juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth it) be deprived of joy, who deemeth deliverance from evil a plunge into miſery, I in the mean time praying, Thy will, <hi>O God,</hi> be my delight and proſperity.</p>

               <p>WHICH ſo happening according to my wiſhes, I ſhall not now (as formerly) let my thoughts creep low, nor ſhall I brook their defilement with what I my ſelf tread upon. Earth ought not to claim with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a participation of us. It were enough to deſtroy the hopes of our harveſt, ſhould we, notwithſtanding the husbandry dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently managed, and our field well manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, let tares ſpring up among our wheat. Let us not ſuffer any thing, which was meant for our good, to turn to our hurt. It is both pity that good ſeeds ſhould unluckily be oppreſſed in their growth, and evil ones permitted to flouriſh in contempt of art; which, if it happeneth in mans heart, it is a ſign of its <hi>being nigh to curſing.</hi> We are rackt and torn, <hi>large furrows made on our backs, and the Ploughers go over our heads,</hi> that evil and unprofitable ſeeds may be overlaid and periſh. Here the intent of the good husbandry is quite averſe to a fond nouriſhing or indiſcreet foſtering of them; but yet that is not all. The labour would be reduced to the number of folly's impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vanities, if only to this purpoſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone. But the conſequence of overturning bad ones is a prudent diſpoſition of better in their places. And ſo doth the heart receive
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95462:25"/> only thoſe ſeeds as its own, which have their injection after ſo excellent an order; which, when they have taken root, do thrive wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the proſperous hand of the divine hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry. For indeed tribulation worketh in us thus much, that we love <hi>God</hi> after a ſincere ſenſe of it, more than we did before in a corrupt ſenſe of his earthly gifts. For there is apparently in them more of his bleſſings, becauſe unqueſtionably more of his love. We, meeting with forreigners and ſtrangers, are commonly more addicted to liberality and outward tokens of courteſie, than to reprove thoſe vices, which we ſee in them; but wholſome reproofs we lay in ſtore for the homebred inheritours of our fortunes. Acts of indulgence to ſuffer men peaceably to enjoy (as to the outward, man can do nothing to the inward) Lands, riches, and eſtates may be extended to ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; chaſtiſements men uſe to their belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved children. Wherefore the puniſhments of this life are far better than the benefits of fortune. We then deſervedly apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much, praiſe <hi>God</hi> for his unſearchable wiſdom, and love him for his ineffable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>God,</hi> who ſpared not his own <hi>Firſt-begotten and Well-beloved,</hi> in not ſparing us, manifeſteth his affection to us as well-beloved
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95462:26"/> and heirs of his promiſes; and we by being exerciſed in his love <hi>grow from grace to grace, from ſtrength to ſtrength, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we appear perfect before God in Sion the coeleſtial.</hi> Tribulation in this life doth not only try and correct us, but maketh our inward man more gloriouſly to advance his trophies over ſin; it maketh us eminent in the practice of the better part, and richer to our ſelves, becauſe we treaſure up in the Soul thoſe jewels, which the dull pleaſures of the world bury all over in oblivion. I condemn not peaceable tranquillity, it is to be the care of our hearts; I condemn not proſperity, <hi>God</hi> hath frequently given it to his great Favourites. But without reaching an offenſive finger towards the diſturbance of any of its well-compoſed ornaments, I will preſume to ſay, that it becometh more glorious after a conflict with adverſity, and is not truly ſplendid till furniſhed with luſtre from afflictions ſtore. Things of the world even the beſt, although good, are yet imperfect when compared to heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; of the number of which I judge affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to be according as <hi>God</hi> ſeeth meet to beſtow them. And although in either eſtate it is not impoſſible for a man to live piouſly, yet becauſe adverſity is an approved
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95462:26"/> and more certain way to Heaven, becauſe proſperity, if it be not altogether remiſs, is commonly not ſo exact (as it ought) in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of good, the one is permitted to ſucceed the other by way of probation, and adverſity ſtill carrieth the day. She is <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions</hi> more natural nurſe, becauſe freed from pride, which is a cloſe adherent to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious felicity, and hath thoſe goods to which proſperity doth unwillingly ſtoop, <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> And adverſity poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the ſoul of theſe two majeſtick, yet humble graces, what need I more words to make my comment upon her more copious? Would we have peace, tranquillity, joy and all inward happineſs upon earth: Here are all theſe in loves banners to be diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Would we have glory, joy, reſt and felicity more than earthly? <hi>Obedience</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth at them, and giveth them unto us here in aſſurance, hereafter in deed. And as theſe give vs joy and peace, ſo are they alſo their Guardians placing them above humane contingencies, and out of the reach of curs'd <hi>Fortunes</hi> malicious arreſts. Our joy is <hi>in heaven,</hi> where alſo <hi>our converſation is,</hi> and while there we may be ſure it is fixed and immoveable. So we, impartially ſurveying the immenſity of <hi>God</hi>'s love, find afflictions
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95462:27"/> of the body to be the riches and welfare of the Soul, and the impairing thereof the building up of our perfections. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whereof doth eaſily induce us to profeſs that although <hi>God</hi> be pleaſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe our patience in hardſhips, we will <hi>not caſt off our joy</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> which have ſo <hi>great a recompence of reward;</hi> neither will we ceaſe with that worthy <hi>ſufferer</hi> to ſay, that <hi>although he ſlay us, yet will we truſt in him.</hi> Of which <hi>ſufferer</hi> yet more. What was there in him but <hi>love</hi> towards <hi>God</hi> ſtill carefully nouriſhed, when he tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all thus patiently, <hi>What ſhall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive evil?</hi> And as he received them pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, ſo aſſuredly joyfully. For <hi>thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi> being the exuberance of <hi>joy</hi> and a <hi>fecundation</hi> of <hi>Benefits,</hi> he giveth thankes for the former afflictions, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed be the name of the Lord;</hi> which afflictions have ſoon after an addition. It was not ſaid of him, that he was that <hi>man of God, who was diſobedient to the word of the Lord,</hi> whom the <hi>Lord delivered to the roaring Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which tare him thus in peices,</hi> but that <hi>he was perfect and upright, that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God and eſchewed evil.</hi> But all was done for his compleating; for whereas we
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95462:27"/> may think that nothing could be added to uprightneſs and perfection, yet we muſt conſider that the very epithite of perfect doth admit of a ſuperlative, and that him, who was perfect, <hi>Gods love</hi> would have yet more perfect, 'ere he come to that perfection, which is above humane capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. He who was perfect as to what he had, was imperfect in an indigent bareneſs. I cannot ſay he wanted patience, but he had been without the reward, as well as we without the example, if he had not met with his tryal. So by <hi>adverſities</hi> friendly mediation he became poſſeſt with <hi>a crown,</hi> even <hi>the crown of patience,</hi> which before could not be due unto him until he had overcome, and herein alſo manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf <hi>perfect and upright, one that feared God and eſchewed evil,</hi> not by fear but ſubmiſſion; he ſubmitted to the evil of fortune patiently, rather then to the evil of corruption fooliſhly. He could not thorowly effect his Victory over his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, whom he encountred, with ſo many unneceſſary clogs as before cumbred him, therefore he would go forth againſt him caſting off all help ſeemingly good in the worlds eye. And thus was he made more ſufficient for the overthrow of his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95462:28"/> daily watchful and perniciouſly ſubtil <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.</hi> Being robbed of all outward goods, his internal he the better preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which were thus efficacious and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to no damage. Had he not been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly impoveriſhed by his <hi>plotting ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> he had not been ſo gloriouſly trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant over him, nor taken the crafty in his own deviſes. Here was the intention of <hi>Love,</hi> which was not unjuſt in afflicting, but merciful in ſuſteining. <hi>Hope</hi> was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſufferings, and <hi>Certainty</hi> ſuſteined by loſſes, and he made almoſt greater then a <hi>Saint,</hi> becauſe reputed a <hi>worm and no man. God</hi> loveth us too much, unleſs we loved him more and valued his Love at an higher rate. He hath voluntarily and even humbly obliged himſelf to love, and would force us to become dear and precious in his eyes by the continual <hi>royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of his <hi>goodneſs</hi> oppignorated to us from the cradle to the Sepulchre. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to benefit us by <hi>the kindneſſes</hi> of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity</hi> and <hi>the indulgencies of adverſity.</hi> He created us to the one and redeemed us by the other. Our <hi>Redemption</hi> then was <hi>Love,</hi> our <hi>Creation</hi> was <hi>power;</hi> although then he can ſave us by his <hi>power,</hi> yet let us not deſire it without his <hi>love.</hi> He valued and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95462:28"/> purchaſed us by afflictions, labours, blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and death, not becauſe we were of ſo much worth, but that we might be of more worth by his powerful affection to us. Let us ſuſteining, our own caſualties and miſerable condition in this life, become powerful to an able and free return of <hi>love,</hi> to ſuffer a little in <hi>love</hi> to him, who ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (nay ſuffereth) much more in <hi>compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us.</hi> We have nothing immortal but our <hi>Souls,</hi> and even theſe are made liable to <hi>deaths</hi> cruelty, unleſs that in life we dy. If living by imitating <hi>Chriſt our life</hi> we dy, we may reſt aſſured that our <hi>life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi>

Yet theſe things have our <hi>hopeful Reformers</hi> done, whoſe <hi>religion</hi> at the firſt compoſure conſiſted of theſe ingredients, <hi>Hypocriſie, Contumelies, direful Revenge, Ambition, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God</hi> and his <hi>power, a Delight in the deſtruction and miſery of the guiltleſs, Thirſt after blood, Sacriledge and exorbitant luſt after other mens fortunes.</hi> As to the two laſt I mentioned, it did ſmoothly paſs with <hi>the vulgar,</hi> and was currently believed, that they intended nothing more than a repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things; ſo much did their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence bear before it the ſhew of ſincerity, with which, and the name of Devotion, they for a ſeaſon guilded all their crimes. But when their beguiled helpers had given them <hi>the Crown and Church-lands,</hi> and the prey was between their teeth, reſtitution was found to come much ſlower than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. They found the revenues too weighty, having turned them over to themſelves, to return them to <hi>God</hi> or the <hi>King.</hi> Neither was it probable (had they been able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcry it) that the <hi>vulgar's blind hopes</hi> ſhould ever have a clear iſſue, or that they who
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95462:31"/> had made an ill beginning to the whole <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> ſhould ever make a good end to <hi>God.</hi> But the peoples eyes were at length opened, when after the ereption of ſome particular <hi>Delinquents</hi> (as they called them) whole Eſtates, and other mens <hi>compoſitions,</hi> near of kin to thoſe total ereptions, the ſame hand at laſt ſtretcht over all in general began to gripe hard as well its <hi>Allies,</hi> as <hi>foes,</hi> its <hi>Defenders</hi> and <hi>Offenders.</hi> So was the miſt removed from their darkned eye, when the candle it ſelf began to be touched; when <hi>the pretended reformation</hi> was known to be <hi>the baſtard</hi> of unſatiable <hi>luſt.</hi> O it is a religious thing to receive. And their <hi>Idol-god Profit</hi> muſt be appeaſed with Prayers of lyes and humane Sacrifices, that ſo a propitious income might make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for their labour and induſtry, and cauſe their hopes to abound. But if their monthly and annual Harveſts were not ſtore enough to fill their garner, they had alway ready ſome religious rogues of their crew (zealous defenders of their <hi>God</hi>'s privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges) who could craftily ſearch Desks and Cloſets, yea and hearts too, to find, make and ſwear out either old <hi>Delinquents</hi> eſcaped their clutches, or new ones, ſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by their conſenting to plots, which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95462:32"/> they never heard of, or making plots, of which they never thought. And then <hi>Juſtice</hi> (which with <hi>God</hi> is made to come bearing up <hi>Mercy</hi>'s train, even when incorrigible iniquity deſerveth puniſhment) hath her ſacred name and authority injured, which ſhe is feigned to be preſent and active in the condemnation of <hi>the innocent.</hi> I am forced to cry out, <hi>Sinner that I am, where ſhall I fly for mercy, if this were juſtice?</hi> yet beſides all this, <hi>God the Rewarder</hi> of juſt actions only, and <hi>the Avenger</hi> of the unjuſt, muſt be thanked for theſe things as a well-willer and approver of them. How do I here even doubt to affirm what I know, that ſuch as invocated the name of <hi>God,</hi> and ſpake of the ſincerity due to him, in religious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, ſhould ſo far provoke him as to commit ſin boldly, and with affection to it? But that they ſhould withal glory in it, and to his face make him the author of it, would ſeem utterly incredible where it had not been ſo notoriouſly known. Having ſaid this, I need not tell you that the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of our <hi>Forefathers,</hi> and of <hi>God</hi> in them directing and diſpoſing their <hi>counſels</hi> to his <hi>glory</hi> in conſtituting good and wholſom <hi>Laws Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical and Civil</hi> for the <hi>reward</hi> of <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>puniſhment</hi> of <hi>vice</hi> muſt of neceſſity be
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95462:32"/> trampled under foot, where unruly and helliſh paſſions exerciſe their liberty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bit or bridle caſt into their jaws. <hi>Vice</hi> getting the upper hand of its laſh, knoweth no reſtraint, no more than doth the <hi>Author</hi> of it when his chains are broken, and his fetters looſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for where <hi>licentiouſneſs</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſway <hi>Rule</hi> is an unknown good. By the ſame power of <hi>pretended juſtice,</hi> as others, was the <hi>Hope</hi> of the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> welfare ſunk, the <hi>Sun</hi> of our day darkned, the <hi>Defender</hi> of our lives and liberties Spiritual and Civil <hi>(who was worth ten thouſands of us)</hi> in an unhappy hour taken away. When then the <hi>Lawgiver</hi> was taken out of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>our Crown fallen to the ground,</hi> how could we expect <hi>moderation,</hi> there being none to hold the reins? what <hi>diſcipline</hi> among the vile <hi>Patrons of confuſion?</hi> or what <hi>Church government,</hi> where there was left no viſible face of a <hi>Church?</hi> But, ſuch as they were, we had governours many, although not good ſtore; for according to <hi>Moſes</hi> his foreſpoken curſe, aſſuredly to follow <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, The ſtranger to the Commonwealth of our</hi> Iſrael, <hi>was made the head, and we the tail;</hi> they were made <hi>governours,</hi> true <hi>governours, Subjects.</hi> They, who were to go in and out before the people, whoſe lips

               </p>
               <p>CALLING to mind ſome of our paſt days revolutions, I found theſe with innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable others, to preſent themſelves to my view. I made uſe of the firſt comers for my preſent occaſion. Enough were theſe ſet down, nay, too too many, had it ſo pleaſed <hi>God,</hi> who knoweth better than our ſelves, what is moſt meet to be tolerated; whoſe wiſdom as it tranſcendeth all humane reach, ſo its diſpoſals of us our ſelves ought not by us to be limited. If our <hi>Phyſician</hi> for the health of our bodies tells us, that ſome blood muſt of neceſſity be taken from us, in regard we acquieſs in his skil and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we patiently ſuffer his will; neither at length may we ſay it is enough, when he knoweth that more muſt be ſhed. Well may we then wholly reſign up our ſelves into the hands of the moſt wiſe and faithful <hi>Phyſician</hi> of our ſouls, and live for ever. We muſt ſubmit, and after ſubmiſſion conſider the benefit, which doth loudly ſpeak it ſelf unto
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95462:34"/> us ſuch as the artifice of the inſuperable love hath wrought it. Surely nothing hath been in theſe inteſtine commotions loſt by any one for <hi>God</hi>'s ſake, but <hi>God</hi> did at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent repay it with <hi>himſelf.</hi> The <hi>ſoul</hi> had liberty to treaſure up life, while the <hi>body</hi> was rackt neareſt to death, and <hi>God was at hand a ready help,</hi> when the need was of greateſt extremity. What we have now, <hi>Peace</hi> at home, <hi>Religion and liberty</hi> reſtored, <hi>a gracious King</hi> over us, <hi>lawful Magiſtrates</hi> among us, and the former <hi>authority</hi> of our <hi>National Laws</hi> ſetled as heretofore, we ſhould not ſo much prize, if we had never known the loſs of them. <hi>Pride and fulneſs of bread</hi> cauſed too much inward diſdain and outward irreverence of <hi>God</hi>'s bleſſings, which now we learn to look upon more ſeriouſly, and uſe more thankfully. For my own part, my <hi>King</hi> (whom enjoying I truly eſteem my ſelf to live, whoſe ſafety I do and ever ſhall (<hi>God</hi> being my helper) to my utmoſt endeavour, accounting it mine own welfare) might in much probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity have had leſs of my heart, more of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard, fewer of my prayers, more of ungrateful forgetfulneſs, if my ſouls free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had never been curbed through his enforced dereliction of his <hi>Crown and Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties.</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:95462:34"/> So might I have been more liable to a more imminent danger, that of <hi>diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and breach of <hi>God</hi>'s commands (who would have <hi>Kings</hi> honoured as ſacred, and their very names not to proceed from our lips without eſpecial reverence) which might ſuddenly have depreſſed me into irrecoverable miſery. How many there have been in former times of this number of negligent ſubjects I know not. But of this I may reſt confident that multitudes have repented of their remiſſneſs, having been thankful for that <hi>rod of their chaſtiſement,</hi> which at laſt made them know their <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>themſelves.</hi> Some men in conſideration only of their worldly condition could libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bemoan themſelves as deceived by their own wiſdom. For while they warily kept themſelves as neuters, thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to lye hid from ſpiteful fortunes moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they loſt both their honeſty and their hopes. Their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to <hi>the moſt pious of Princes</hi> (who thought nothing too dear for his people) they willingly forgat out of a daſtardly fear of loſing what indeed they could by no means keep. But their fears being paſt by the loſs of all, they could ſee their errors, and bethink themſelves how much might theirs with the like loſſes of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95462:35"/> men in their condition have advanced that juſt cauſe of their <hi>lawful Soveraign,</hi> if they had made a timely reſignation of themſelves and part of their poſſeſſions unto him; how much ſo many perſons hands and aſſiſtance might have ſtrengthned him, if they would but have righted themſelves in defending him. An <hi>unprofitable infidelity</hi> did at laſt make theſe <hi>loyal,</hi> when <hi>loyalty</hi> was become full of infirmity. But theſe being ſenſible of the moſt deſpicable weakneſs of humane wiſdom, or rather the fallacies of worldly confidence have found out a better ſecurity by relying on the wiſdom, which is more than humane. Yet amidſt all that could happen, no faithful ſubject (a juſt value of all things conſidered) repineth at his loſſes, becauſe they were all in ſome meaſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and in whatſoever their preſent fortunes ſuffered diminution, they were in the ſame or greater meaſure recompenſed. As we ſtood affected towards our <hi>King,</hi> ſo alſo towards our <hi>God.</hi> Some mens wills both to the Spiritual and Temporal warfare were equally poyſed; <hi>Religion</hi> obſerved not ſo much out of ſincerity as cuſtom, witneſs that frozen zeal in many, which gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the ſly rebel to accuſe all. But to thoſe, who were not altogether bankrupt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95462:35"/> of ſincerity the enſuing alteration had but an harſh relliſh, inſomuch that they ſaw it high time to make lukewarm affections exiles, when through the want of zeal to <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>cauſe</hi> they enabled each miſcreant to climb to the height of what either his pride ſuggeſted or his hopes purſued. To ſee the ſtrange alterations of <hi>divine Worſhip,</hi> to ſee <hi>God's holy Name</hi> made the amuſing cover of all prophaneſs, the name of <hi>Juſtice</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Regicides</hi> and <hi>Parricides,</hi> was enough to awaken that drowſie <hi>Spirit of indifferency,</hi> which could content it ſelf with a <hi>remiſs holineſs,</hi> and a <hi>piecemeal performance of duty.</hi> Thoſe, whom pleaſure had before bribed, ſorrow had now made to ſpeak truth and acknowledge our <hi>Churches</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in the polite decency and graceful compoſure of its <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> and other <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</hi> For as nothing maketh men love virtue more than the beholding others o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in their vitious behaviour: So many men (beſides the <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> and <hi>Inſtability</hi> of the <hi>Components</hi>) conſidering the ſlight fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries of a <hi>Directory,</hi> and the whimſical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of men in their newly introduced worſhip, needed not eloquence to ſpeak the former <hi>Service high and majeſtick.</hi> It was commendation enough of the <hi>former</hi> to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95462:36"/> ſee the <hi>later</hi> ſo meet an object of contempt. <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> go as mates hand in hand. <hi>Pride</hi> walketh along with a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious gravity, and with an overweening diſdain beholdeth other men and their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; but conſulting with <hi>Ignorance</hi> at her right hand, now to tread each ſtep with a graceful deportment, and following her advice, thoſe altitudes of ſpeech and geſture become not admired according to expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but inſtead of admiration cometh firſt neglect, afterward ſcorn and laughter. He, who maketh outward ſhews of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, muſt have correſpondent inward ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to bear up the outward frame. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding men will not be cheated by the tranſparent abuſes of <hi>Pride.</hi> Had ſome complaints in hatching before our inteſtine commotions proceeded no farther, it had been more to the credit of the pretenſively virtuous <hi>Rebel</hi> in two reſpects: Firſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the puniſhment to come looked upon as due unto him; Secondly, in regard (his pretences and deeds being ſo different) his face would not have appeared ſo ugly to the common view. For thouſands, who at firſt heard only their complaints, but ſaw not their intentions, have extolled the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants for religious and well meaning, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But they, who were alway reſolved where they had began to end, were then enlivened one way, although ſadly dejected another way. Although they wept at the ſight of their <hi>natural Mothers</hi> countenance transfigured with inundations of tears and blood, and their <hi>ſpiritual Mothers</hi> choiceſt jewels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to contempt, yet were they revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the remembrance, that when they had loſt all, they notwithſtanding held faſt their faith, and had ſo well merchandized as to exchange their <hi>reputations</hi> and <hi>eſtates</hi> for <hi>the crown of patience,</hi> to barter <hi>earth</hi> for <hi>an heavenly inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE was nothing in all this, but what might give advantage to the <hi>Christian Combatant,</hi> and (as to himſelf) improve his joy, the <hi>Conqueſt</hi> being foreſeen and the <hi>Reward</hi> foreknown. For although <hi>without were fightings within fears</hi> of pretenders and undermining <hi>Informers,</hi> yet what could they do more, who had left nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done? They might lay a greedy hand upon our bodies, and all thereto apperteining; but upon the riches of our ſouls (as the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95462:37"/> delight in <hi>rack-contemning Obedience, and undaunted Loyalty</hi>) their violence wrought no command. Although they encouraged themſelves in our ſpoils and loſſes, yet they miſerably tormented themſelves with the remembrance of our undiſturbed reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. There could no age be more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in miſeries than that; yet none more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable in their own and moſt mens eſteem than <hi>the miſery-inflicting adverſaries.</hi> If all the inventions, that the malice of <hi>Devils,</hi> and men worſe than <hi>Devils,</hi> could ſuggeſt, might entitle us to miſery there wanted nothing, which might make it compleat, and <hi>this world an hell.</hi> And yet even then did we triumph over calamities, having indeed ſighs and tears to ſpend for the authors thereof, whom we had learned to pity, becauſe by fools only eſteemed happy. We did as we ought, rejoyce; not according to the <hi>Epicures</hi> vain preſcriptions, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe men to fortifie themſelves againſt the occurrent miſeries of life by the ſtill enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of ſurfeiting pleaſures; for theſe pleaſures were not then to be reached. But in us, as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> did this <hi>joy</hi> take up its proper place.

               <p>NOW is our <hi>revenge</hi> throughly wrought; we deſired not <hi>evil,</hi> and behold <hi>good</hi> came. We were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently (as we only ought) avenged of our adverſaries by deprecating their ſouls ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, by pitying them, whoſe ſelf-created miſeries were the bittereſt of our afflictions. And we aſſuredly find that <hi>love</hi> is a pregnant paſſion having conceptions and productions beyond ſuppoſition. While <hi>God</hi> conſidered the ſilent rhetorick of our hearts freely diſpoſed to forgive, and heard thoſe louder cryes of our ſighs and tears for their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he anſwered them with ſuch ſucceſs as ſuited with our deſires becauſe with his glory; but hath moreover added ſuch bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits as tranſcended both our deſires and hopes. Our deſires if they did fly high, yet could not ſoar ſo high as <hi>God</hi> can reach, nor could they dive ſo deep as the deſcents of his humble bounty. <hi>He maketh the out-going of the evening and morning to rejoyce,</hi> and bringeth <hi>joy</hi> unto us farther than the eyes

Whether in our <hi>Sun-ſetting</hi> or <hi>riſing</hi> he is the ſame <hi>light</hi> ſtill, and his day hath no end And although the ſhadow, as it were of an approaching night, mindeth us of our natures declination ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what darkening our underſtandings, yet, where <hi>God</hi> is, the light of <hi>joy</hi> is ſtill perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, however it be for an additional de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light changeably repreſented. The ſubſtance is ſtill the ſame, notwithſtanding its various dreſs (as I may ſay) doth beguil the natural viſion, and multiplieth one into different pluralities. That invincible peace of mind, which although ſtill worried, is unalterable, after a long conflict with the treacherous world becometh at laſt augmented; having ſooner wearied all than it ſelf, it is rendred greater by its conqueſt, and more joyous through a continual diſdain of ſlaviſh ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. And <hi>God,</hi> who loveth <hi>patience,</hi> loveth alſo to have an end of it, and to give it the ſame end and beginning, alacrity and the diffuſed bliſs of a calm ſecurity. Which end (when <hi>Patience</hi> hath had her perfect work) he wiſely ſetteth at his meeteſt time, ſometimes making delays where he will give more than an ordinary joy to the former ſtock treaſured up in an extraordinary trial. Otherwhiles he diſpenſeth with time, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95462:41"/> (in a ſort) thinking his love abſent, when it is not burthened with ſpeedy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches of ceſſation and reſt. So he did by his good friend <hi>Job,</hi> whom he held not out the lingring expectation of another life, but gave a reſt and recompence on earth as the ſhort <hi>emblem</hi> of a recompence eternal. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> after ſuch a degree of ſervice is <hi>eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita;</hi> and <hi>the ſoul</hi> having been long enough exerciſed therewith, ſhe is exempted from farther labour, and reſigneth her place to ſome other <hi>Virtue.</hi> Neither, becauſe a true <hi>joy</hi> may and ought to be retained in the fiery trials of temptations, is it always neceſſary that we puſh thoſe pikes. <hi>God</hi> will give unto his ſervants more than a bare ſingle cauſe of rejoycing; he loveth to multiply them, that ſo they may be known to be his gift, who giveth not by peice-meal, neither is ſcantingly liberal. The <hi>influences</hi> of his <hi>bounty</hi> are proportionable to his unlimited <hi>love,</hi> deſcending as for divers cauſes, ſo in divers manners. By variety and multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of gifts his <hi>bounty</hi> is not diminiſhed, but is amplified and enriched by liberality, and by giving rendred (as it were) more able to give. Now after we have a while patiently endured his will, his benefits by courſe ſo run, that we no longer ſuffer
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95462:42"/> but receive. Either in <hi>heaven,</hi> or both <hi>earth</hi> and <hi>heaven,</hi> there is for us aſſurance of having the former benefits of <hi>ſuffering</hi> compleated by an <hi>immunity</hi> from ſuffering, and even this <hi>immunity</hi> crowned with all acceſſory <hi>joys</hi> befitting a triumph. Come we now to look back upon ſcoffs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, ignominies, contempts, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever injuries; they could not harm us, becauſe not laſting; and the very fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of their ſpeedy end muſt needs excite our <hi>joy.</hi> A moſt divine expreſſion is that of his, who introduceth <hi>that incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Pattern of patience</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Author and Finiſher of our faith, who for the joy, that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame;</hi> even for the <hi>joy,</hi> which was the evident ſupport of his <hi>ſouls</hi> ſo weighty burthen, and unto which he was to run throughout the race of finite miſery. It is a cowardly part to fear that enemy, whom we know we can out reach, and he is but puſillaminous, that is diſturbed with grief and fear for that calamity, which he is ſure to out wear, and (if he pleaſe) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to contemn. Things of little or no continuance have not their name or value among durables: and how can we judge
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95462:42"/> that evil, which peradventure would prove ſo, if it could purchaſe life, but is extinct al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſo ſoon as it beginneth to be? Our life here for the very brevity of it may (we ſometimes think) ſcarce juſtly be termed life; yet affliction hath not a leaſe of that little, which is, but is put to its progreſſes and retirings; nay, each <hi>hope</hi> cruſheth it when it is moſt powerful and high. Theſe things conſidered, are enough to force up the fire of joy into a ſacred flame, even while it is daſhed with the billows of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, and beſhowered with the ſtorms of miſeries; for after this ſtorm is over, the day will prove fair, and our preſent heat will be ſufficient for the preſent occaſion. And ſurely although all <hi>God</hi>'s works are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to draw us towards him, and to ſix our whole delight in him, and that with a <hi>love</hi> pure and unfeigned, which <hi>caſteth away fear,</hi> and although <hi>adverſity</hi> do this effectually, yet he at laſt giveth <hi>proſperity</hi> too. For the ſame thing is aimed at in both, and both relliſh well enough with the pious <hi>Soul,</hi> but the later is more pleaſing to the <hi>bodies</hi> guſt, and <hi>Gods love</hi> to us is ſuch, that his <hi>ſoul will not alway ſtrive with man for that he is fleſh.</hi> We are f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95462:43"/> ſo that that <hi>joy,</hi> which for a while did ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear up, may at the laſt lack <hi>faith,</hi> and ſink, therefore ſhall it have a relief and change; but only when <hi>God</hi> ſeeth his time. As <hi>God</hi> intendeth at his conſtituted time to ſatisfie <hi>the longing ſoul</hi> with himſelf in eternity, and with it the companion of its labours, advancing <hi>the body</hi> to that glory to which (as ſupernatural) it can lay no claim without <hi>the ſouls</hi> more priviledged grace: So doth he here ſometimes as it were by viſion give an appearance of our entry into <hi>that glory,</hi> by converting the exuberance of our ſorrowful eyes into ſtreams of pleaſures, and flouds of pious rejoycings. And all this is for the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of his own <hi>power,</hi> and confirmation of our <hi>faith;</hi> that as we have ſeen him able to create good out of evil, and light out of darkneſs, we may believe him able to ſtop the inſolent proceeding of the foot of pride, and after a preparation by temporal favours to enlarge them into ſpiritual and boundleſs. <hi>God's glory</hi> is our <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſtrength.</hi> This to him raiſed out of the two <hi>great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites</hi> of <hi>good and evil,</hi> becometh to us the <hi>united effect of joy.</hi> The ſundry contrivances of it become to us but one entire, becauſe a perpetual <hi>joy;</hi> and we ſtill through <hi>love</hi>

For as her labour juſtly claimeth the reward ſhe aimeth at; ſo neither doth ſhe catch at flies ſeeking by a mean ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to repair the loſs of paſt time. It is <hi>felicity</hi> in the fulleſt meaſures, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can counterpoiſe her grand performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Nothing leſs will ſerve the turn, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this unleſs ſought with an anſwerable labour. Honour becometh not ſuch to the magnanimous, unleſs he hath paſſed through vales of horrour, and in purſuit of it over-run mountains of contradicting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities; nor is Eaſe at laſt accounted a bleſſing to him in the foreſight, unleſs he can ſee it through multitudes of difficulties and laudable attempts. But then cometh <hi>Honor</hi> like it ſelf, and <hi>Reſt,</hi> which ſhall not be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted with reproach, when the <hi>Purchaſer</hi> hath his head adorned with the beauteous <hi>flowers</hi> of his own well-huſbanded <hi>Garden,</hi> and with a cheerful countenance eateth the ſavory <hi>fruits</hi> of that <hi>vine,</hi> which his own <hi>curious hand</hi> hath planted, dreſſed, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95462:46"/> meerly by labour nouriſhed until it came to good liking and Perfection. Our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father <hi>Adam</hi> had in his <hi>puniſhment</hi> this much <hi>hope,</hi> that he ſhould not be eternally miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble becauſe entitled to the benefit of a labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>toleration,</hi> which always looketh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to <hi>felicity</hi> and a <hi>reward.</hi> Although he deſerved nothing of happineſs in regard of his ſin, yet he could not but comfort himſelf in the hope thereof being thought worthy that injunction to labour, which faileth not of a recompence. For the good, which by ſuch a beginning and an anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble continuance ſhould be purſued, muſt undoubtedly be more then moderate. Our peace with <hi>God</hi> (which includeth bliſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable) is wrought by inevitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts with the adverſaries of it. A Worldly <hi>peace</hi> is frequently acquired with <hi>effuſion of blood,</hi> and is alway to be conſerved with <hi>vigilancy</hi> and <hi>laborious care.</hi> Nay each pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite delight ambitiouſly publiſheth its worth by its difficult procuration; as if it were impoſſible for that to give <hi>content,</hi> which never gave <hi>moleſtation.</hi> Every thing, which hath but the appearance of good giveth man this demonſtration, that his choice part of life hath its enjoyments either under or from durance. Holy <hi>David</hi> would not <hi>ſacrifice</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:95462:47"/> to <hi>God</hi> of <hi>that, which coſt him nothing;</hi> for by that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> religiouſly offered he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the conceſſion of a merciful <hi>bleſſing;</hi> Therefore would he not have his <hi>offering</hi> an <hi>undervalue</hi> to his <hi>hopes.</hi> Indeed all that we have or can is <hi>Gods,</hi> ſo cannot our beſt facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties merit any thing at his hands. But if he be pleaſed with that ſatisfaction, why ſhould we not give him largely of his own (abilities of ſoul, body and temporals) that the more we give the more we may receive and live happily by becoming (as I may ſay) prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal towards him out of his own bounty. Our faculties are his gifts, ſo that what we bear is by his ſtrength, (which we ſometimes abuſing cauſe our own miſery and his greif) but when he ſendeth joy as the reward (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the work be his own) we rejoyce for our ſelves. To the <hi>faithful and good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> it was not ſaid, <hi>Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,</hi> before that by due tryal it was found he deſerved an <hi>Euge;</hi> but when that appeareth the <hi>ſervant</hi> ſhall become a <hi>ruler.</hi> A little labour ſometimes obtaineth an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable and large recompence. It is alway ſo between us and our <hi>God,</hi> who for our feeble endeavours, which he is forced to ſtrengthen, giveth not onely more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally then we can deſerve (for it is ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95462:47"/> enough to us that he mercifully aſſiſteth) but alſo more bountifully, then he hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us power to conceive. But without ſome perturbations cometh no good at all. <hi>Joy</hi> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily gotten is as eaſily loſt; it is over whelm<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed in a moment being but the treacherous forerunner of ſome approaching <hi>misfortune. God</hi> giveth very uſually that, as beſt which nature in the birth eſteemeth as worſt. <hi>A ſorrowful beginning</hi> for <hi>God's</hi> ſake findeth a <hi>Joyous concluſion,</hi> nay an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Joy</hi> through <hi>God's love.</hi>

               <p>BUT they, who would have their life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from ſufferings, are moſt ſure to ſuffer. Not ſeeking what they ſhould, they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable fall upon what they ſtrive to ſhun. <hi>The wiſdome of worldlings</hi> in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is rather to inflict then commiſerate or be co-partners with thoſe, wholy under <hi>the rod of the Oppreſſour.</hi> They defraud their underſtandings and will of true delight, by hankering about meaner pleaſures, for the reach of which they care not how they get up above others trampling them down with the foot of inſolency and ſcorn.

The one now looks upon his <hi>proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> as <hi>the ſpoils of victory,</hi> and his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſerved for it; the other laugheth
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95462:56"/> but as it were for company with a fainty ſence of pleaſure, and is either in his heart looking another way (as before) upon more ſenſual pleaſures, or bethinking himſelf how and where to pour out the <hi>tears</hi> of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerating and envious <hi>grief.</hi> Now he that doth any thing to obtain his <hi>Ends</hi> or ſecure his <hi>fears,</hi> propoſeth to himſelf a <hi>joy,</hi> yet doth but,</p>
               <q>—Propter vitam vivendi pendere cauſas.</q>
               <p>BUT it is requiſite that I vindicate <hi>proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity</hi> and extol it now, although I before condemned it. Yet neither did I diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this now in diſcourſe, nor can I be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to praiſe that before condemned. As for that <hi>proſperity,</hi> which I before ſaid to be <hi>the Souls canker,</hi> it was ſuch as fomented na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures too too violent inclinations to vitious contentments, and incited man to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manning himſelf. According as <hi>proſperity</hi> giveth <hi>joy,</hi> I either acquit or condemn it. If in our <hi>Joy of Reſtauration</hi> any depreſſeth his <hi>Soul</hi> with meer temporals and debarreth it the priviledge of aſcent into the preſence of the compaſſionate <hi>Reſtorer,</hi> what doth he but <hi>reinthral himſelf</hi> and <hi>torment his joy?</hi> If the uſe of the gifts brought in with <hi>peace</hi> be more frequent then of <hi>peace continuing
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95462:56"/> gratitude,</hi> the man thus uſing them doth at the moſt (and that too not without checks) rejoyce but to halves; his <hi>diviner part</hi> is both hindred of her <hi>ſtight</hi> and blinded from her <hi>Joy.</hi> The temptations of illuding vanities grow more and more importunate, and they, circumventing the man, nurſe him up (as if in true pleaſures) in unſeen miſeries &amp; conjure him to an ignominious ſlavery. He embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth rotten deformities, and uſeth means with expedition to unbind the contignations, and let fall into irreparable ruine the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered piece of mortality. So doth <hi>proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> become his <hi>Scourge,</hi> becauſe he, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or neglect of <hi>God</hi>'s glorious ſervice, becometh the Worlds ſlave. Or again, if we have too able memories to recollect the ſurreptions and loſſes ſuſtained in the late barbarous broiles, and becauſe theſe breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are not made up, to charge our hearts with repinings intermixed with joy, what do we but make uſe of our ſtrongeſt faculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to cheat our ſelves? We are to look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to what is to come, nay, to conſider what advantages we have in the happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of <hi>King and Church.</hi> Many (it is true) are <hi>the inſiduous baits</hi> laid for us every where and way; but while <hi>God</hi> is our chief deſire <hi>proſperity</hi> helpeth, nor faileth us.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95462:57"/> Therefore to thoſe, who conſtantly behold <hi>Gods will</hi> as their moſt deſireable <hi>pleaſure, the good</hi> wrought in ſuch varieties maketh wonderfully for the heightening of their <hi>Joy.</hi> None but a diſtempered palate think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth bitter ſweet and ſweet bitter, for a ſound body hath a diſtinguiſhing guſt: So ſincerity of Religion giveth ſound judgement for the election of the moſt ſavory delights, the Sum whereof is <hi>God,</hi> the particulars whatſoever perſeverance in Love promoteth to the underſtanding.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>GOd</hi> is alway <hi>a ready help;</hi> but more eſpecially at time of need. Our own induſtry is but a blunt ſtupidity (take it in the moſt refined abilities) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his exhibited aid. Our neceſſities would be more urgent upon us then our wills could be active for us, ſhould our beſt ſubterfuge from danger be our own meer contrivance. But <hi>God</hi> is ever preſent; yet more ſenſibly in the time of greateſt neceſſity, when he ſeemingly hath abſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf. He ſeemeth not preſent, when neceſſity is abſent, becauſe but remiſsly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated. In time of need prayers are our refuge, till our deſired <hi>Supply</hi> cometh, who ſometimes anſwereth our expectations ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſometimes later, according as we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pray, or he ſeeth expedient. He doth frequently delay until our preſſures grow almoſt too too weighty, and then
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95462:61"/> he becometh a ſpeedy and powerful <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer.</hi> Indeed the ſordid ingratitude of man taketh notice of no deliverance, but ſuch as is miraculous, and ſeldome much of that, after the wonder and need are both over: ſo far is <hi>God</hi> from our hearts, although alway preſent in our enjoyments, they being his liberallities. And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our ſlight eſteem of the more common favours, <hi>God</hi> doth ſuffer our dull acknowledgments to be ſharpened by the want of thoſe his bleſſings ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued, and that ſuch want as may make us ſufficiently to remember even our dayes of forgetfulneſs. Then, when our crooked diſpoſitions are ſet ſtraight and upright, we have leiſure enough to bemoan our ſelves and lament our paſt vileneſs, but ſcarce wiſedome to foreſee our eſcape from the quickſands of thoſe perplexities, which we have no reaſon to deem other then inevitable. Nevertheleſs <hi>ſuccour</hi> cometh borne upon the wings of <hi>Providence,</hi> and quaſheth <hi>Tirannizing fear</hi> in the midſt of its ſurprizals.

                  </gap> time a letter of reprieve, or an hand of help to a ſinking and ſoul expiring perſon, was our deliverance gratious becauſe more
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95462:61"/> improbable, nay very miraculous. The commonneſs of our calamity was before our general comfort; ſo neer was the fatal knife to the thred of our hopes. But it is never too late for <hi>God</hi> to put a ſtop to the proceedure of malicious practices. He findeth not any time paſt, or any thing difficult. What to humane underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may ſeem an impudent neglect, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to him a well ſlighted occaſion, and our beſt time is not alwaies his. <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> hath its fulneſs of time, which (let man never ſo impatiently labour to haſten it) will not be prevented nor deferred. Witneſs this our former expectations, and our preſent acknowledgements, which praiſe <hi>God</hi> for his wiſe and ſucceſſeful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes. In due time <hi>God</hi> gave us a <hi>Moſes, a Princes, a Ruler, and a Lawgiver,</hi> under whoſe conduct we have been led out of more then an <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſlavery. We have loſt nothing by our hope being deferred, the length of time being well ſupplied by the perfection of our <hi>Bleſſing; a moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Prince,</hi> and we hope that what time was wanting to him and us, in his deſired reigne over us, may in the felicity of many enſueing years be returned to him as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional <hi>Crown,</hi> to us an encreaſe of <hi>joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:95462:62"/>
               <p>AND of this his calm return giveth us an extraordinary aſſurance. He affordeth us by the ſerenity of his demeanour a large proſpect of felicity, if our wayward <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs</hi> (like the never contented <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi>) change not the bleſſings deſigned us by his miniſtry into <hi>plagues</hi> and <hi>curſes.</hi> We have ſeen his forgiving nature abhorring ſuch crimſon pleaſures as are more ſanguinary then neceſſary for <hi>Gods</hi> glory. <hi>Innocence</hi> conducted him a nearer way home then to ſwim through <hi>a ſea of blood.</hi> He thought it not good to return the ſame way, by which his enemies forced him to depart. <hi>God,</hi> who uſeth to win by forbearance, and <hi>delighteth not</hi> ſo much as <hi>in the death of a Sinner,</hi> was his <hi>Pilot</hi> and brought him home <hi>to the harbour of reſt by peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deſires.</hi> He would have civil diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and fraternal jarres ceaſe, and that we hear not hoſtile and diſtracting <hi>Alarms,</hi> but onely ſuch harmleſs claſhings as delight and recreate; that by our exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and union we may the better reſiſt forreigne contrivances and attempts.</p>
               <p>HOW truely <hi>Golden</hi> would our <hi>Age</hi> have been had this rare patern found an univerſal obſervation, had real <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> met with a free acceſs into every heart?
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95462:62"/> But it doth not a little interrupt our rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that many harbouring unquiet thoughts do prepare War againſt themſelves. A little gall marreth a great quantity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate wine, and a few <hi>dead flies cauſe the Apothecaries</hi> precious <hi>oyntments to give a ſtinking ſent:</hi> So doth a little of the leaven of diſaffection in ſome few give fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent repulſes to our copious and active joy, while we are forced to mix ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with thankſgivings, and commonly to ſigh for their miſeries in the midſt of our own triumphs over miſery.</p>
               <p>IT is ſtrange that the <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> which illuminateth moſt, ſhould blind any. But if deformed and vitious Souls turn things ſacred into ſin, and wholſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies into the nature of their own diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, <hi>God's</hi> Grace is nevertheleſs wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. If the <hi>wicked man</hi> poyſoneth his <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes,</hi> and maketh himſelf worſe by the receipt of them, the fault is not in her <hi>Phyſitian.</hi> Although the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> forceth his will to obſtetricate to ſenſuality, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring to ſilence all thoughts of a <hi>God, God</hi> recedeth not, neither is the more abſent, but filleth the World with the brightneſs of his glory. The perverſe fool may term <hi>Providence, Chance,</hi> but yet adviſing with
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95462:63"/> even his own reaſon, he may confute him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. However we know who it is, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth Sublime and excellent things out of indiſpoſed materials. We know that our preſent <hi>promotion came neither from the Eaſt nor from the Weſt,</hi> blown by accidentiary winds, but it was <hi>God's finger; he is Judge,</hi> ſetting up the right and depreſſing the wrong. Let whatſoever adverſary read himſelf thoſe looſe lectures, which his heart onely ſuperficially entertaineth; yet no <hi>Diabolical Subtilty</hi> can withſtand thoſe <hi>quick lightnings,</hi> which <hi>God's</hi> powerful works do dart upon his <hi>conſcience.</hi> And know he muſt, that whereas he would bribe his <hi>internal witneſs and judge,</hi> he doth but the ſame as he, that would retrive rivers back to their Fountains, and chain up the winds in an imperious Den or Caſtle; ſo impoſſible it is to confound that habitation of equal <hi>Juſtice,</hi> where nothing is pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Our <hi>Kings</hi> many and Miraculous deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances from moſt eminent dangers, and the thred of his life interwoven with du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and protection, may in all reaſon ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the <hi>parlour Sermocinatours</hi> of <hi>rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</hi> They all know (and ſome confeſs) whoſe work both <hi>preſervation</hi> and <hi>Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> is; yet they retain a certain inflexible
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95462:63"/> ſtiffeneſs. <hi>God</hi> muſt be beholding to them for a certificate of approbation, or the work ſhall be none of his. Nay, if the preſerved <hi>King</hi> and grateful people ſatisfie not their exorbitant luſts before the will of the great <hi>Preſerver,</hi> they will attempt the undoing of what <hi>God</hi> hath done, as if aiming at the annihilation of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>BUT their powers and wills are not in the ſame conſiſtory, being as far divided, ſo unequally active. And he, who now diſableth, did formerly diſappoint. They, who formerly endeavoured the fruſtrating of <hi>Providence,</hi> were their own puniſhments in many fruitleſs attempts, but now they are, eſpecially by neceſſity of forbearance of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, which in will hath been long ſince peretuated.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER let them do and think what they will, experience teacheth the us truth of this, That <hi>although hand joyn in hand the wicked ſhall not be unpuniſhed; but the ſeed of the righteous ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</hi> That the later is performed is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſome onely to behold, who are (beſides their ſin) more miſerable then any, as being the peeviſh Authors of their own ſufferings.

               <p>ABUNDANTLY and moſt deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly may we thank <hi>God</hi> for this <hi>Sum of mercies, A King.</hi> From each of <hi>God</hi>'s mercies flow ſo many rivulets, as there are perſons to enjoy it, or that is hours to be enjoyed; But this is a <hi>Mercy</hi> containing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable of the greateſt. The free uſe of <hi>true Religion</hi> is one inexplicably. Which that each perſon may apprehend, let him with calm and ſerene thoughts quiet thoſe tumultuous waves within him toſſing his affections to and fro at will. Then may he with an inquiſitive devotion look into our ſacred <hi>Miſteries,</hi> and return to himſelfe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95462:64"/> charmed out of all crooked prejudice by their noble blandiſhments and pleaſures. Adde we to the ornament of this bleſſing the mercy of uniteing <hi>Peace,</hi> which he that deſireth not, deſerveth to be ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to ſhame and miſery, and juſtly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteth our wiſhes, that his own peace one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he may ſacrifice to his fury until his temper by ſuffering becometh pacificatory. The magnanimous <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who mindeth the general good more then his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intereſt, findeth himſelf there ſafeſt, where none fear, and maketh his chief <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> to be <hi>his Houſe,</hi> who taketh pleaſure in ſeeing <hi>brethren dwell together in unity.</hi> But this bleſſing without our <hi>King</hi> was not to be hoped for. The <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Crown properties</hi> ſit neither commendably nor quietly upon any head and ſhoulders but the right. Beſides (for <hi>God</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily aſſiſt thoſe, to whom he giveth the <hi>ſacred Prerogative</hi>) they are too weighty to ſit long on any wrong head or ſhoulders without a downfal or removal. Either of which happening <hi>the ſhip of ſtate</hi> falleth in peices, the compoſure of which will never be effected by ſuch croſſe-byaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed affections as (at ſuch a time) common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approach to the management of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95462:65"/> work. So while many contend for the <hi>Maſter-ſhip,</hi> all is loſt. And in ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtions, where ſome hope and moſt fear, there is onely laughing work for forriegn ſpectators. But this evil is removed when the <hi>right hand</hi> holdeth <hi>the ſword of Juſtice,</hi> when he, who onely ought, beareth ſway and juſtly requireth <hi>Obedience</hi> in all.</p>
               <p>WHAT happineſs I here ſpeak of in our enjoyment of him, our <hi>Sovereigns</hi> titles foreſpeak unto us in theſe words, <hi>King and defender of the Faith.</hi> There needeth no more commendations of the firſt then a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the paſt times, which were moſt ſad, diſmal and utterly obſcure for want of <hi>this radiant Luminary. The Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> then keep his <hi>feſtivals,</hi> and (prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereto by him) <hi>every man did that, which was right in his own eyes.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary goods hoped for and to be effected by the power of the <hi>Regal preſence,</hi> may juſtly multiply ſuffrages in its election and eſteem. Accordingly we have known the joy, and heard the acclamations of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at our Kings return; A voice grown much louder in twenty years ſpace. A Prince wiſely eminent is the expreſs image of God upon earth. The loſs of ſuch an one therefore could be no leſs then an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95462:65"/> dejection into <hi>Cymerian darkneſs,</hi> which tyranically uſurped a Soveraignty over our benighted ſouls. But violence in the extreames being leaſt durable, the glorious beames of <hi>Kingly ſplendour</hi> have victoriouſly diſperſed thoſe thick miſts and obſcuring vapours; and our languiſhing ſpirits are revived by the bright rayes of his (ſo much longed for) preſence. The happineſs to be found under regal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is amply manifeſted by the events of the contrary. Our own memory may ſerve inſtead of reaſons. But among ſome commendations of it <hi>God's</hi> own words are expreſs and highly obſervable, <hi>They ſhall ſay, we have no Kng, becauſe we feared not the Lord;</hi> where the cauſe of deprivation was <hi>the Kingdomes ſin,</hi> and <hi>a Kings abſence the Nations plague.</hi> And as to our ſelves we had long been ſick of, and deſperately groaning under the miſeries of <hi>a changed and ſtill changing ſtate,</hi> but remembring our ſelves deſervedly puniſhed as privy to our own diſtempers, when ſometimes we ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>God's</hi> ſavours at ſuch time as we were full of them, conveyed to us through this <hi>Golden Conduit;</hi> we did bear it as we might, but do now mightily rejoyce at our recovery. As therefore health is truly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95462:66"/> ſo eſteemed by thoſe, who have felt the bitter outrages of a perilous diſeaſe and have been reſcued out of the very jaws of death; whereas their careleſs thankfulneſs ſcarce owneth the <hi>Supream Preſerver,</hi> who were never ſenſible of him as an angry <hi>Correct our:</hi> ſo we may be taught to prize <hi>God's</hi> ineffable bleſſing, and to <hi>ſin no more leſt a worſe thing come unto us</hi> then our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpaſt miſery. Humble ſupplication pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth, and gratitude prolongeth divine favours. As long as we know and are our ſelves <hi>God</hi> will ſmile upon us and reigne over us by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TRUE greatneſs is alwayes that, which keepeth the road of virtue and goodneſs. They were the prayers of an undoubted and bleſſed <hi>Martyr, a King</hi> for a <hi>King,</hi> rather that he <hi>ſhould be good then great;</hi> but withal hoping that God had <hi>deſigned him to be both,</hi> that is, <hi>King and defender of the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ancient and Apoſtollick faith.</hi> That <hi>God</hi> hath made him the one is to the performance of the other, and that he will alway prove both, he giveth us to hope and believe. Which <hi>Title</hi> if ſome (according as their ſeveral humors tranſport them) will not acknowledg due, for their ſakes do we
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95462:66"/> chiefly rejoyce to apply it. The want of their conceſſion maketh no diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his honor. That he Laboureth by example &amp; power to reſtrain the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diſtempered brains in a general good, even theirs over whom the power is exerciſed, would deluſion ſuffer them to ſee it. But that we have one to <hi>ſay to the fools, deal not fooliſhly, and to the wicked, lift not up the horn,</hi> is an eſpecial felicity; which <hi>God</hi> hath given to them, who are deſirous to ſerve him in truth and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Whoſe prayer it conſtantly is, <hi>That God would ever give him to the Church ſuch a nurſing Father, under whom her Children may thrive and proſper, and devotion be che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and magnified, that glory may dwell in our land, and the beauty of our God might rest upon us.</hi> Great men by their good examples do exceedingly propagate piety, which is by ſo much rendred the more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, by how much it is admired and practiſed by illuſtrious perſons, who are

               <p>GOD, in his love to us through our moſt bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> hath in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure provided for our ſouls and bodies. He hath given his <hi>Church</hi> beauty and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, and we hope that he will add ſtrength too by a <hi>King,</hi> who cannot but know how to rule his people, for whom and with whom he hath been throughly tried; he hath learned to cheriſh them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf alway cheriſhed <hi>in the boſome of the Almighty</hi> to be returned to us a ſure pledge of <hi>Gods</hi> love; he knoweth how to rule them, who hath manifeſted his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and power over himſelf in ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>revenge</hi> and in ſilence paſſing over (&amp; ſo expiatiating) thoſe numerous <hi>injuries</hi> &amp; <hi>indignities,</hi> which might otherwiſe have injured the <hi>Nation</hi> with the brand of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>infamy,</hi> And as we found in him a noble acknowledgment, that his Subjects have not been all guilty (but many of them
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95462:67"/> partakers with him) of his miſeries; ſo we reverently adore that admirable temper of <hi>Majeſty</hi> mixed with <hi>meekneſs, hands</hi> bountiouſly open to reward the conſtant, and <hi>armes</hi> expanſed to embrace the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; whereas <hi>ſowre aſpests</hi> and <hi>revengful hands</hi> had been leſs then the merit of thoſe to whom his favour hath been beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure extended. Herein he hath truely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to the world how fitly the <hi>Scepter</hi> burtheneth his ſhoulders, how hopeful a <hi>Governour</hi> he may juſtly ſeem in his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> eyes, who could ſo eaſily ſway his own paſſions.

So did his <hi>moſt gratious Majeſty</hi> moderate his courſe being princely and undejected in his loweſt condition, humble and full of clemency in his exalted. No offers or temptations could deduce him from his love, zeal to <hi>that Religion and Church,</hi> wherein he had been ſo carefully educat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95462:73"/> thought and care for <hi>God</hi>'s ſake and love, he aſſureth himſelf of no leſs recompence then <hi>God</hi> himſelf. The <hi>King</hi> is under <hi>God Religions</hi> great <hi>Guardian,</hi> in whoſe face how do we read lines of care for us? Let aſtoniſhed and Watchful thoughts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with prayers (which uſe to procure <hi>Angel Guards</hi>) be ever employed for his concerns, that he may receive the fruit of his labours, our pious and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant cares returned for his perplexities. We by our <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſedulity mitigate the harſhneſs of his cares, who is moſt perplexed for thoſe, who neither regard <hi>God</hi>'s glory nor their own good, who will not be <hi>obedient</hi> leſt they ſhould be too too <hi>happy.</hi> We ſhould all amend, that he may be eaſed. And truely if we be careful to our ſelves, we ſhall not be wanting to him, we ſhall lighten both his cares and our own. If we account his enemies ours, the care is divided; he beareth but a part and we but part, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though each one beareth all out of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affection to his and the general wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; and at laſt the ſucceſs is good and certain, there being in all a religious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animity. This care proceeding from love becometh earneſt in its labours, ſpeedy in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95462:74"/> its ſervices, conſtant in its reſolutions, and valiant in its executions. It will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to ſecure our ſelves firſt and ſerve the <hi>King</hi> afterwards, nor to break off our ſervices in the midſt by abrupt counſels, but with a deliberate judgement to ſerve him in ſeaſon, that we reap the harveſt of his approbation, and joy in his ſmiles. There is an abſolute <hi>marriage</hi> between <hi>the King</hi> and his <hi>Subjects,</hi> whereby there are interchangeably given aſſurance of <hi>Faithful adherence</hi> to each other in <hi>adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> as well as <hi>proſperity;</hi> he cannot at all leave, they cannot, unleſs lewdly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly, ſorſake him. Let our endeavours therefore be ſtrong and ſerious, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with prayer to <hi>God,</hi> that he would cheriſh him his boſome, that (according to his promiſe to the <hi>King) through the mercy of the moſt high he may not miſcarry,</hi> that he may have in all abundance of ſincere Love, although little cauſe to put it to trial, and this through the merits of <hi>Holy Jeſus, our moſt bleſſed Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WEE cannot but ſee our ſelves ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged by <hi>God</hi>'s Lawes and common gratitude to ſee the <hi>Kings</hi> welfare both by us and from us. Now I come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether a Subject be any way capable
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95462:74"/> of being accounted meritorious according to the common vaunt, when he hath done the utmoſt he can for the heightning his <hi>Majeſties</hi> proſperity. <hi>Obedience</hi> to his call and command is a duty towards <hi>God</hi> more than man. This obedience is <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, which is right in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> (according to the <hi>Scripture phraſe</hi>) and not in the ſight of man alone. It hath <hi>God</hi> for the prime <hi>motive</hi> and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <hi>Hope.</hi> If therefore there be any, who vaunt of a meritorious ſervice in any em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of this high nature, they befool themſelves out of the reward and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of <hi>Obedience,</hi> for as much as they manifeſt that they have not yet learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>obedient.</hi> And ſome there are, who ſpeak loudly of their being inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the reducement of our <hi>Soveraign,</hi> whom themſelves had formerly forced <hi>to wander as a bird from her neſt.</hi> And theſe are a ſort of men ſeemingly very religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but we may judge of them, whom the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> had long before deſcribed from their <hi>making a dogged noiſe about the City, and grudging that they are not ſatisfied.</hi> Theſe are abortive Children of the <hi>Church having the form of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs but not the power.</hi> Theſe with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95462:75"/> obedience expect a reward for their ſervice, and this the faireſt and beſt jewel in their <hi>Maſters Cabinet.</hi> If they had come with that <hi>Benjaminite,</hi> who had curſed the <hi>King,</hi> to meet him upon his return with, re-cognitions of ſorrow, if they had put the halter about their necks, confeſſing their former merit, they had done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like Subjects, much like like converts and penitents, meet to be forgiven and embraced; but then onely when unlawful practiſes could not bring about their foul deſigns to come and meet him (the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of whoſe long calamnities had been forged by them and hammered upon their anvil) giveth them an evident mark of notorious inſolence. I am ready to judge with <hi>the wiſeſt of Kings,</hi> that <hi>the the Sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination;</hi> but <hi>how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked heart?</hi> They, who had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time torn in peices thoſe robes, were at length ſet out in <hi>Loyalty's</hi> dreſs, that what they had failed of by <hi>diſloyalty,</hi> by the <hi>fucus of Loyalty</hi> they might at laſt obtain.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER theſe men would be taken for Religious, they have high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſed and worne bare their plea, ſo that through <hi>it pride and hypocriſie</hi> break
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95462:75"/> forth and become apparent. For there is neither <hi>humility</hi> in <hi>ſubjects</hi> giving laws to their <hi>King,</hi> nor <hi>religion</hi> in perſwadeing him contrary to his well grounded <hi>judgment,</hi> and the received <hi>Principles of truth.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they alſo indiſcreetly thwart themſelves, who, while they would not have violence offered, to their <hi>conſciences,</hi> are violent even without arguments and againſt reaſon in obtruding a <hi>religion</hi> upon him. Their perſwaſions would be other, and they more ſubmiſſively meek if they truly conſidered what calamities their contentions for <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> involved both <hi>King and Kingdome</hi> in; neither can any underſtanding head give it ſelf the hopes of any better fruits from any <hi>Religion</hi> which ſubjecteth the <hi>King</hi> to the <hi>Churches cenſures.</hi> Certainly true <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> commandeth us all ſubjection and in the moſt exact manner to <hi>Honour the King,</hi> to depreſs our ſelves, and our beſt actions to cover with ſilence, whereby they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched and made acceptable to <hi>God.</hi> He looketh upon our <hi>ſimplicity</hi> in the firſt place, and knoweth what is done for his ſake and honour without our vain glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proclamations. It was ſurely vilany and not any thing to be drawn into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the act of the <hi>ſouldier who ſpit in the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95462:76"/> face of him,</hi> whom he had before <hi>ſaluted as King;</hi> or if there be in ſubjects an ill gotten power, they ſhould (methinks) ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor that paterne and copy of him, who ſaid to his <hi>Prince, All this will I give thee if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> Men of true piety uſe not to boaſt of their pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down and ſetting up <hi>Kings;</hi> nor will they uſurp <hi>God's</hi> power under pretenſe of being eminent in his <hi>Church.</hi> I am very loath (eſpecially in theſe times) to bring an invective againſt my fellow ſervants, and thoſe claiming the name of <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> But I am much more loath, that that <hi>Name</hi> ſhould be aſperſed by the practices of thoſe who bear it, while they recede from <hi>primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive purity</hi> entangling themſelves in the tentes of thoſe, againſt whom they declaim, as if their intentions were to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> although their face is as if they would go to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> I know both how much diſpleaſing it is to rehearſals, and what cenſures he muſt undergo, who layeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to publick view errors, which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate <hi>Authour</hi> would have concealed. But the diſpleaſure and blame will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly placed upon him, who really aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at what others onely pretend to, <hi>the glory of God and the general good.</hi> And if the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95462:76"/> of the times did not open the lips of men of the moſt known modeſty, by theſe kinds of diſcourſes, informing me of the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice of theſe complaints, I might peradventure ſuſpect my ſelf either guilty of a miſappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or at leaſt too ſevere in my indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In truth I heartily wiſh there were place for ſuch a ſuſpition, and that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick knowledge would not bear me the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of innocency. A triumph over mine own errours would adminiſter unto me am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple contentment, and in this caſe the joy of the publick welfare would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme my ſorrow; ſeeing my ſelf, and not them miſtaken.</p>
               <p>BUT the felicity is too great to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Could we ſee them begin to keep within the preſcript rules of modeſty we might from thoſe ſparks blow up and kindle our hopes. But their both words and deeds, declaring their own ſhame, encreaſeth our ſorrow. They ſpeak themſelves ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times great friends, whom we know to be reconciled enemies, (and would to <hi>God</hi> they were reconciled in ſincerity or were of a reconcilable nature) of whom all cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary adviſes bid men beware. In the midſt of thoſe benefits, which ſhould ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly binde the knot of reconcilement, they
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95462:77"/> are moſt apt to ſhew their diſſimulation, being never more ungratefully dangerous then under accumulations of kindneſſes. All that ever hath been granted, hath been debt and merit, and their demands do cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourouſly out reach all bounty. If we ſhould ſuppoſe their deſerts great, yet we find it an uſual admonition of one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that if any perform an act of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie to his ordinary friend, he may not ſtretch the skin of his eye-brows in a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado, neither make his tongue, an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vanity, the trumpet to ſound an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IT is not ſo much to be admired, that men, ever looked upon as high mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and inſincere, ſhould by the ill breath of their own commendations blaſt and raiſe a ſcab upon the graceful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a good deed, as that amid ſuch variety of Bleſſings as <hi>God</hi> hath, by his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties</hi> happy return, ſhoured down upon this whole nation, the ſhrill voyces of complainers have and do drown the moſt acceptable acclamations of thankfulneſs. Being full of the coeleſtial <hi>Manna,</hi> we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wanton, and will not want words to reproach the <hi>Giver.</hi> Every condition is fairer and more contenting then the preſent ſo much do our thoughts run diviſion, and we abhor the touch of the ſame ſtring twice together. We deſire, yet fruſtrate our ſelves of the enjoyment of our deſires obtained by giving nouriſhment to new deſires. We droop under one want, which is ſcarce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, but we beg others and more intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, When we roar for very diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95462:82"/> of heart being born down by ſome weighty calamity, it commonly happeneth, that deliverance was never ſo acceptable, that we were never ſo weary of the burthen, as we quickly become weary of eaſe. The man in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> who had the Devil caſt out, and the poſſeſſion of his own home wholly to himſelf, could not in his heart enjoy a colitary bleſſing, nor retain a profitable gueſt; but after ſweeping and garniſhing his houſe readmitteth his plague, and with him <hi>ſeven more worſe than himſelf.</hi> That which of a place of miſery had begun to be <hi>a Paradiſe,</hi> how ſoon doth he convert it into a real <hi>Hell?</hi> what greater miſery than to be ſtill jerked with our reſtleſs fancy, and toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by our own fluctuating will? What more deſpicable infatuation then to permit our ſelves to a continual labour in queſt of that, which having we utterly diſown? <hi>God</hi> no ſooner in his wiſdome for our good diminiſheth our ſtore, but we preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly add to our ſins either illegal practiſes to encreaſe it, or diſtruſtful complaints, more (perhaps) for fear of a future, then indeed becauſe of any preſent neceſſity: On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, when our low condition moveth him to pity, he no ſooner ripeneth our ſmall hopes into a ſpeedy harveſt, but we
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95462:82"/> fault both the manner and matter of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality. But the chearful man alway feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with his bleſſing of content, is as wary as he is happy. Have he more or leſs of either proſperity or adverſity, he bleſſeth <hi>God</hi> above all and for all, and blameth none but himſelf. It is truly a wretched life, which we paſs in this world. But whence have the miſeries thereof their growth but from our ſelves? They are of our own planting? and by our ſins we as well nouriſh them as we gave them a being. And if at any time the hot ſun-ſhine of proſperity ſcortch them, even when we ſhould rejoyce, we uſually (not knowing when we are well) with querulous waters of our ſtreaming eyes refreſh and quicken them. We our ſelves are many times apt to languiſh in mind that they may proſper, not being able to diſcern Gods bleſſings, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when we are by them too full and too fat. If (with the <hi>Iraelites</hi>) we have flocks and herds, we want bread; if we have bread, we want drink; if we have flocks and herds to kill, bread and drink anſwerable, yet there muſt be variety of fleſh for luſts ſake, yea and that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, or elſe heaven ſhall be alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and upbraided with the plenty of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95462:83"/> paſt dayes under other governments. And then cheifly when there is no want of any of theſe, but an exceſſive variety, when moreover we are upon the confines (as it were one foot entered into the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion) of our <hi>Canaan,</hi> the noiſe of <hi>a Lion in the way,</hi> and the height of <hi>the ſons of Anak</hi> make us deſire a return into <hi>Egypt</hi> to engage our ſelves in ſlavery, no more to expect a ranſome. Now if we do but conſider in what an unneceſſary trouble we involve our ſelves, when our licentious deſires go roving up and down not attending the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pleaſure, nor liking the method of his diſpoſals; how we ſtill ſeek and either find not, or find to no purpoſe, by reaſon we ſtill antiquate the laſt invention or hope; how our inſufficient fancy worrieth and baiteth it ſelf, and all we do or ſay tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to confirmation but ruin of body and ſoul, we ſhould contentedly fix our ſole hope in him, who loveth us better then do we our ſelves. There is no evil befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him, who is contented; no good, him, who is diſcontented with any thing but himſelf, eſpecially him, whoſe diſcontents no good (although in accumulations) ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenceth or calmeth. What miſchievous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences doth man ſuffer in himſelf,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95462:83"/> when he doth not correct and deaden the bitter paſſions of his heart which the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning relliſhes of the ſaving fruit of <hi>the tree of life!</hi> What a diſdainful thing is it for a Begger to refuſe his almes, and expect to be a chooſer, to be his own carver, when at the laſt (poor fool!) ſeeing a large table furniſhed with much variety, he knoweth not what choice to make, what delicates to prefer? It is far more grievous and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable to trample upon Gods munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, becauſe when he hath royally and abundantly given, he doth not humour us with a <hi>Pleaſe your ſelves.</hi> Thoſe are moſt barren ſouls, whoſe longing the coeleſtial bounty cannot ſatisfie, which are not more pacified with plenty then ſcarcity, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſharpened and encreaſed. This evil is the curſe, &amp; fortune of the wretchedly ſelf plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing murmurer. He is even his own curſe, and through himſelf alone perpetually reſtleſs.</p>
               <p>HOW do I here find my ſelf obliged to pity thoſe, whom I cannot but cenſure and condemne? Pity I needs muſt the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe men, who (as it were artificially) contrive their own downfal; whereas by being an happineſs to themſelves, they would be acceſſory to the building up of other mens joyes. The world, which we
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95462:84"/> commonly (and not injuriouſly) term a vale of miſery, is ſo more truely from the evil we do than the evil which we ſuffer in it, the evil we ſuffer being the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of what we do. It is not ſtrange that ſorrow ſprout up round about him, who hath the very root of perverſeneſs ſpreading it ſelf within him. Such is he, who when he ſhould make his heart the nurſery of virtue, ſuffereth <hi>the Father of diſcord</hi> to plant their jealouſies and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, which bring forth ſundary vices. How gloriouſly bright did that day of <hi>Gods</hi> favourable viſitation appear, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced (after he was pleaſed to throw down the fictitious reſſemblances of <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which in ſubjects we could not bear) true <hi>Majeſty</hi> to ſit upon the <hi>Throne,</hi> and ſway the <hi>Scepter</hi> of this <hi>Brittiſh Iſle?</hi> How reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly and fervently did we for a time ſeem to joy in that goodneſs, which ſo miraculouſly conjoyned the <hi>ſeparated Head and divulſed Members?</hi> But how long? The ſplendour of that day continueth nay increaſeth, yet ſome think it to be now in its ſetting, becauſe they malitiouſly cloſe their eyes, and what they will not ſee, cannot behold. The cauſes of this joy the firſt fundamental <hi>Goodneſs</hi> conſerveth;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95462:84"/> great is their blindneſs, who are uncapable of it, greater their wickedneſs, who by denial of it, would obſtruct it. If it hath its full influences, why do ſo many ſcatter abroad doubtful rumours and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious complaints? If it doth not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, how doth the Cauſe abide and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of ſober men deceive themſelves with the contentments of the Effects? The fulneſs of our ioy was wont to be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this, <hi>The King is reſtored, and long may he live.</hi> Was this joy too violent to laſt long, and we, through long abſtinence and deſire, apt to catch a ſurfeit of ſo great a pleaſure? This could not be. For there is nothing, wherein <hi>God</hi> truly is, which is ſurfeiting, or that can be immoderately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. Therefore the reaſon of this great diſtemper muſt needs be, that the general gladneſs was intermixed with particular hopes, which either would not endure time, or were diſcouraged from proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or are yet erected, and by this means prepare for innovation.</p>

               <p>Their complaints are different, but are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs complaints, and ſpeak the Authors ill governed affections. Though all are not
<pb facs="tcp:95462:85"/> alike offenſive, yet none of them are inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, none innocent. They are all ſowre rehearſals of that garbidge of diſcontent, which they have unadviſedly ſwallowed.</p>
               <p>OF the firſt there are two ſorts; the one is diſpleaſed that he receiveth too little, the other that he payeth too much.</p>
               <p n="1">1. HE hath indeed the moſt forcible arguments of any to plead his excuſe, if his tongue hath ſtrayed ſomewhat out of the way, who bringeth Neceſſity to ſpeak for him, who hath adventured far, hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his life, made a voluntary and free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his blood, ſuffered ruin of eſtate, bear reproaches, impriſonments, ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (of the remainder, if any thing were left of a broken fortune) hunger, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and even utmoſt of calamities; that could willingly have lain in the grave bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and gnawed by thoſe foul and inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vermins, which ſurrounded him, ſo long as theſe miſeries were common; and now onely deſireth to be revived by his Lords reſurrection. But neceſſity is no excuſe; for no man is neceſſitated to evil. Let not (I ſay) their words pierce his <hi>ſacred heart,</hi> whom he loveth as his life, nor let the <hi>Heroick excellencies</hi> of paſt dayes be ſummed up and diſparaged by this final of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95462:85"/> that good ſubjects who have ſuffered with him and for him, ſhould any way endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour releif, rather than deſire that he ſhould now ſuffer for them. For ſo many are the dayly and unexpected exigences of ſtate, that the great boone they expected (if his <hi>Majeſty</hi> were reſolved upon it) would no ſooner be beneficial to ſome, but it will would prove deſtructive to all.

               <p>IT is indeed too too true that our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities have given us a large field of complaints; but we are ſurely out in the method.

When miſcheif practiſeth all its acts and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, confuſion and diſtraction muſt needs be the unhappy product; and why do the Authors ſeem to ſtand amazed at it? We alas! find diverſe ſorts of complaints, and each murmurer (not without violence to reaſon) perſwadeth himſelf that he hath ſome reaſon, ſome ligitimate motive to what he ſaith, when the contrary is moſt true. Let the affections be cleared up and the influences of regal adminiſtrations have their due work, mens tongues would be more reſerved, their diſtempers would be qualified, their paſſions calmed.

               <p>FOR theſe bleſſings do the people yeild themſelves, to be reduced and hearken to their inſinuations ſo eagerly. They have, it's true, better things promiſed; but it is ſtrange that men, whom no performances have juſtified, ſhould yet find a ready be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and that the people court their abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as if woful experience had given them no caution.

Therefore when we uſe either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventives or remedies, the fear of an evil induceth us to uſe ſuch means, as we Hope, will remove the incumbent, or preſerve us from enſuing matter of dread. But fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as men are poſſeſſed with <hi>empty Hopes,</hi> ſo are they (as it were) diſpoſſeſſed of themſelves by <hi>cauſeleſs fears.</hi> Such are the <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Hopes</hi> fomented by ſeditious <hi>murmurers.</hi> What fear of innovation in <hi>Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

They dread nothing more then reſt, and ſecurity; as they know it not, ſo neither do they deſire it. Would they then give the ſame meaſure of felicity to their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, which they Hope for themſelves? We ſee the utmoſt of it, it is at beſt but an inſecure and changeable eſtate.

But being by their light informed, I may rather be ſaid to ſpeak their opinions then mine own private ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents or diſcoveries. And I farther wiſh that the contrivances of theſe men were ſo privately agitated, that they came within the veiw of the ſharpeſt judgments onely, and were not by themſelves <hi>proclaimed upon the houſe tops,</hi> that men even of the inferiour ranks might behold them and be ſurprized with previous conſternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before they give the blow.

In like manner am I perſwaded that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their boaſted numbers a timely indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry may put a ſtop to the growth of their potent inſolence. The ſwellings whereof if neither prayers nor tears, no lenitives or balſames can aſſwage, to let the whole be ſeized upon and corrupted is not onely an unſeaſonable but a mercileſs pity. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the hardeſt hearts when they come to uſe the harſheſt means for the patients re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, cannot but have ſtrong conflicts between commiſeration and judgement; which later nevertheleſs ſpeaketh the other uſeleſs, and with men of a well-ballanced temper condemneth it, not becauſe it hath uſed many of the mildeſt correctives, but becauſe after a long ineffectual application neceſſity it ſelf hath not been argument enough prevailing for an alteration.

               </p>
               <p>WAR is begun in words; the tongue ſtriketh before the hands. That ſeeketh firſt to wound, and is alway ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. He, who cannot with his tongue maintain the uprightneſs of his Cauſe, will ſcarce be thought ſufficient to defend it with his hands; Thence it is that the world is filled with ſo many ſeditious invectives. Thus <hi>Treachery</hi> maketh its own guard, and with theſe it annoyeth thoſe againſt whom it acteth But as all actual War againſt Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours is by <hi>God</hi> forbidden, ſo is it his Indiſpenſible Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the Ruler of thy People;</hi> no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, although he deſerveth it, much leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly: Yet this they do, accounting it their excellency, and pretend by ſo doing to practiſe the means of ſecurity.

               <p>BUT it is not much that they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by reproaches to ſtir up the <hi>Subject</hi> againſt his <hi>King;</hi> when they pretend that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelf is in their complicacy: or rather it is no wonder that they mind Rebellion againſt an <hi>Earthly Prince,</hi> that they beſpatter him and his, when they ſpare not the moſt ſublime <hi>Glories</hi> of the <hi>Coeleſtial Hierarchy,</hi> telling the world that theſe Motives come from <hi>God,</hi> and that the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> rejoyce in theſe undertakings. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their vaunts, I muſt be ſtill uncharitable in believing the contrary: For he who runneth may ſee enough to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him, that <hi>the Lord is not in this Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind.</hi> Hope of aſſiſtance from Heaven they can have none, who indeed ſeek it not, but ſtand in defiance againſt it.

Being preſented with theſe, he bringeth the Authors, by the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:95462:121"/> forementioned paths, to the ſecure poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his <hi>Tabernacle pitched without hands, to ſtand upon his holy Hill, and be made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Pillars in his holy Temple.</hi> But how do many, who ſtudy not the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of being found (like the beauteous and <hi>wiſe Virgins</hi> with their <hi>trimmed Lamps</hi>) readily prepared with theſe graces, deceive themſelves with the glimmerings of ſucceſs, even while they hear <hi>God</hi> denouncing the Thunders of his wrath againſt ſuch Proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of ſin? Much more do I wonder, how <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>the World to come,</hi> can be in their thoughts and lips, and they not preſently fall into an extaſie of horrour. The medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our approaching end, is the moſt neceſſary thought to take up both the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and continuance of our life. Our chief ſtudy ſhould be to die well, which is a long Art, and (conſidering the violent diſtempers of our nature) none of the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt. It moreover requireth a peaceable time; but <hi>in War, the Sword devoureth one as well as another.</hi> How much <hi>Chriſtian</hi> then can he be, who is reſolutely contriving an entrance into the Field without the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Guidance, and looketh death in the face, practiſing Rebellion, not knowing but that in a moment he muſt give an account
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:95462:122"/> to his injured and angry <hi>Judge?</hi> Or how much is his zeal to be accounted of, who prodigally waſteth his treaſure of Reaſon, wherewith God hath been pleaſed to bleſs him, to the corruption of other mens judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not conſidering that he who lent that miſimployed breath, may ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it from thoſe debaſed uſes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Speaker bound over to his ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived miſeries? The conſideration of lifes brevity and uncertainty, ſhould (methinks) make every man buſied not in a forreign ſearch, but an home-enquiry after guilt: The time which is ſo ſpent upon others, is clearly loſt; what upon our ſelves, is truly gained. Moſt men, when they ſpeak of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens faults, encreaſe their own; but they who ſpeak to <hi>God</hi> of their own, by the example undoubtedly make many to be ſooner cleanſed. Then alſo hath the ſelf-examiner this advantage of others, that he diſmayeth not at <hi>Deaths Menaces,</hi> having pacified his <hi>Judge:</hi> Whereas the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting murmurers helliſh life here is all his Heaven: He, who exerciſeth himſelf with the laſhes of pious reproof, liveth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably and peaceably, nay joyfully here, but is aſſured of a ſuperabundant joy after the frail body is cloathed with Honour and

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> How little the minds of ſome men are wrought upon: The continual exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of miſcarrying Factions.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>SOLOMON</hi> thought <hi>the deſire accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed to be ſweet to the Soul:</hi> But it was alſo his obſervation, taken from the humour of men over-eager in purſuit of their deſires, that <hi>it is an abomination to Fools to depart from evil.</hi> The ſweetneſs of an accompliſhed deſire is ſoon turned into bitterneſs, when we think it well obtained by any means. He would allow of a ſelf-ſatisfaction, of a moderate purſuit of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which enjoyed, might level and fill up thoſe furrows, which every where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting Fortune maketh in the paſſages and ways of life. But while fooliſh men incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately view ſomething which they take to be good, being over perſwaded by the outward appearance, and carried on with a violent appetite, let reaſonable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, or either certain or probable danger labour never ſo much in the diſabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95462:125"/> them, yet is it to them an abomination to relinquiſh their beloved evil: Nay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have been never ſo often thwarted in the entrances into the poſſeſſion of their deſtructive delights, yet no warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will teach theſe fooliſh ones, whoſe paſſions ſhut the door againſt all manner of reaſon: Then do <hi>they incourage themſelves in an evil matter,</hi> and without fear ruſh on upon thoſe things which preſent themſelves dangerous and dreadful. The Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence frequently beginneth its work with confounding the Counſels, and infatuating the judgments of impenitent offenders, making them run forward upon new practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and deſperate attempts, to their utter ruine and calamity, ſuffering them (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in improbable ways) by the hope of ſucceſs, to delude and befool themſelves. And men who are carried away with uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, do ſo gaze upon and admire their hoped-for felicity, that follow it they will, without ſtaying to conſult the <hi>unerring O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,</hi> or to be led ſo much as by prudence or common ſobriety, <hi>God</hi> juſtly depriving them of the benefit of the latter, that have deſpiſed the former. Fooliſh men, who are wholly in love with their own ways, and like <hi>the deaf Adder</hi> in the preſence of <hi>the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95462:126"/> wiſe Charmer,</hi> can be no where in ſafety, their own counſels leading them into miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, and <hi>God,</hi> whom they have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, altogether forſaking them. Nothing is more treacherous than mans will, being never Loyal, unleſs reſtrained from evil, and conſtrained to good: It conſpireth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Soveraign Powers, and unleſs they moſt immoveably ſit faſt in their <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol,</hi> ſhe debaſeth them to moſt infamous contempt and ſlavery. The <hi>Fools will</hi> is his <hi>Law-giver</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> and he is never obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient but to it, when it ſoundeth the Marches of <hi>Diſobedience.</hi> Then, though <hi>Gods</hi> Commands and Religious Equity diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him from his folly, yet he <hi>maketh a mock of ſin,</hi> and preſſeth forward into the Battle, being victorious in deſire, although Reaſon ſheweth him the Sword by which he muſt inevitably fall.</p>
               <p>TOO too commonly do we ſee Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thruſt down, and ſubordinate to the Will, and then, alas! are the whole trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſafety and felicity put into the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of a wild <hi>Keeper,</hi> who never ſtayeth at home, or of an ignorant <hi>Pilot</hi> that knoweth not his <hi>Compaſs.</hi> In this caſe <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> hath the opportunity to be courteous, to ſhew what ſhe can do in bringing them,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:95462:126"/> who cannot ſteer their own Courſe, into that Port they ſeek. And indeed none elſe are obliged to her; theſe are forced to truſt her, but wiſe men ſcorn her offers, and for their guidance have not <hi>Fortune,</hi> but <hi>God. Chance</hi> maketh ſuch only happy who know not <hi>Providence,</hi> whom an ungoverned will having driven into an Ocean of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous affairs, ſo that neither the means of return nor place of refuge are known, contrary to expectation ſhe thruſteth into her <hi>Antium.</hi> Where when arrived, they frequent her <hi>Temple,</hi> extolling the Graces of their new-found <hi>Goddeſs,</hi> and thinking that her firſt kindneſſes oblige her to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of them; whereas her levity is ſuch, that ſhe waiteth a time to laugh at their vanity, and triumph in their miſery. Fortunes favours are commonly the fooliſh ſinners glory: But they who neglect the governance of <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> and give Luſt the Maſtery of Reaſon, preſuming to find <hi>Fortune</hi> attending their courſe, muſt know it rare to find her, or being found, to have her conſtant. Succeſs in evil draweth many upon the ſame, or greater attempts; but changes being common, ſhould give us caution. All times aſſure us, how wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the beginning plauſible, hath had
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:95462:127"/> Tragical and moſt ſhameful concluſions: Mens fooliſh fancies never feaſt them ſo high at Noon, but that they undoubtedly make the Supper of as courſe Fare as the Dinner was fine. They who truſt that the future events will anſwer the beginnings, will be undeceived when they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cheated, and their glory turned into diſgrace. The hope of a gaining day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at the beginning he won, maketh the Country ſtrangers Purſe empty, and the Cheater laugh at his confidence: So he who reckoneth up his fortunate ſins, ſhall be ſure of a loſing Caſt, which will mar all his boaſting. Some men think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves certainly eſpouſed to <hi>Fortune,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe hath ſung them ſome Love-ſonnets, and imbraced them with flattering kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: But the ſame, who have known her once unchaſt, muſt know her always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant. It is an aſſured truth delivered us by <hi>God</hi> himſelf, that <hi>the proſperity of Fools ſhall deſtroy them:</hi> So is it with the Thief, whoſe lucky diſhoneſty incourageth him to go on till he come to an infamous death, yet his merited reward, the Gallows. And the <hi>Traytor</hi> (kind to none, worſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) having taſted the forbidden fruits of a proſperous Rebellion, by promiſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:95462:127"/> 
                  <hi>Fortunes</hi> conſtancy, and that ſhe will yet add to his Trophies ſuch glories as will fill his aſpiring mind, proceedeth till he be taken in his own ſnare, and falleth the <hi>Executioners</hi> Victim and Prey.</p>
               <p>OUR unfortunate Age (fruitful in the production of men, who were the Curſe and Plague of their time) as it ſaw it ſelf miſerable in thoſe it nouriſhed, ſo in much meaſure avenged of the injuries it ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when the Heads of the Rebellious mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude came to be judged by him whom they had offended, and moſt of the reſt came <hi>each ſubmitting himſelf with pieces of ſilver.</hi> Thoſe who ſuffered not by the Sword of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> but enjoyed the benefit of an unparalled Pardon (<hi>Chriſts</hi> only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) cannot without impudence ſpeak for themſelves, or frame an excuſe. Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion had infected them, and made them ugly; where might they think to appear? Yet were they not ſo ugly, but that the <hi>Eye of mercy</hi> could behold them. In which gracious condeſcention his <hi>Majeſty</hi> mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the exceeding <hi>goodneſs</hi> of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the <hi>Gallantry</hi> of his Mind, that could humble it ſelf to the receiving ſuch into favour. Many who have not been wanting in the work of Patience, have in
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:95462:128"/> this of Remiſſion: And in a <hi>King,</hi> towards Offenders of this nature, the work of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs is far more glorious, becauſe the offences moſt heinous. But Pardon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging to them who repent, I not knowing what to term that <hi>Royal Act,</hi> ſpeak what I know in anothers words:
<q>
                     <l>Nil negat, &amp; ſeſe vel non poſcentibus offert.</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Truly magnanimous was the ſaying of his moſt Pious <hi>Father, I ſtill thought my ſelf undiminiſhed by my largeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, if by them I might gain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the love of my people.</hi> So our moſt gracious <hi>King,</hi> as the <hi>Son</hi> of ſo good a <hi>Father,</hi> ſtudieth the winning of all, and by the invitations of Mercy endeavoureth the recovery of <hi>the loſt Sheep.</hi> Now the more favour is conferred upon reaſonable people, the more the <hi>Favourites</hi> become humbly grateful, that the <hi>Favourer</hi> may be highly joyous. In his Merciful Pardon he gave himſelf, reſolving upon <hi>the largeſt Conceſſion, that he might gain and confirm the love of his People.</hi> It is but fit that the people return themſelves as a part of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that he might find in their beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours at leaſt ſomewhat of that he gave,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:95462:128"/> the fruits of unfeigned Love. I hope <hi>God</hi> hath ſo much mercy in ſtore for him, as to give him many of the Hearts he ſought: yet many are ſuch as they were before, who urged that bleſſed Prince, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, to this character of them, that they were <hi>men who thought to ſatisfie all obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to duty by their Corban of Religion; and could leſs endure to ſee, than to ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Benefactor, as well as their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.</hi> I know not what aileth theſe men, who being forgiven before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, will not be perſwaded yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but ſeek by obſtinacy to invalidate the Power of Mercy, and by adding ſin to ſin, to cut themſelves off in an untimely hour. If by the ſucceſs of former times they aſſume hopes of the like proſperity, let them look upon thoſe examples of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vengeance, the moſt odious <hi>Regicides,</hi> and confeſs ingenuouſly.

Let them not ſo much favour their deſigns with the remembrance of their beſt events, as give themſelves the diſheartening Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of the croſs Events and ill Fortunes of their Complices and Brethren.

                  <hi>utilia à noxiis diſcernunt; plures aliorum eventis docentur:</hi> Surely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections cannot be wanting amidſt ſo freſh examples, which ſpeak this to the world, that <hi>ſuch as think they plot againſt others, chiefly deſigne their own ruine.</hi> They for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly thruſting themſelves into Treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able actions, even againſt their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the further they proceed, the more dangerouſly are they loſt in the Labyrinth of their own errours; and while they are framing deceitful contrivances for the feet of others, their own ſtanding proveth ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and their pernicious wit taketh no effect, but their downfal becometh admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitory. Which to wiſe men is ſo; only the obſequious Followers of Fancy (who think themſelves ſufficient to overtop all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, till by them circumvented, and utterly
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:95462:129"/> loſt) take no notice of the miſeries attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Traytors, by reaſon of humane hatred, and the appointment of Divine Vengeance. They look ſo upon the outward Pomp, wherein ſome of them overtaken by <hi>Juſtice</hi> once flouriſhed, that the admiration and deſire thereof maketh them unmindful of the accompanying evils, and enſuing cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. Who ſo nearly examineth them in their beſt eſtate, when moſt happy by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, when the <hi>Innocent</hi> is ſlain, and they in poſſeſſion of the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> ſhall find the <hi>King of Terrours dwelling in their Tabernacles,</hi> and that <hi>becauſe they are none of their own;</hi> he ſhall find them foreboding terrible things, the confounding conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of their notorious falſity: And following them farther, may obſerve them (who in other reſpects were unacquainted with truth) moſt unerring Prophets of their own ſhame, and certain deſtruction. He ſhall ſee <hi>the ſteps of their ſtrength</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees <hi>ſtraitned, and their own counſel to caſt them down;</hi> that <hi>they are caſt into a Net by their own feet,</hi> that <hi>they alway walk upon the ſnare.</hi> The Complication of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels becometh not unto them a Wreath of Laſting Honour, but rather an unfortunate Cord of Execution, or one of the moſt
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:95462:130" rendition="simple:additions"/> brittle of the black Threads of <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> made of the outcaſt and very deſpicable matter of her labours, which will ſcarce brook time to be ſpun to any length, and then cut off, but ſuddenly ſnappeth aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it ſelf. For beſides that the very nature of it rendereth it apt to ſudden rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, many things intervene to prevent that natural one by a more ſpeedy end: For the time that they are in the height of their Glory, while the vailed Bonnet, and bended knee, with whatſoever admirations of the ſilly Vulgar, who with their vain breath ſwell things beyond their nature, while (I ſay) theſe ſeem to afford them plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and they are much advanced, they are but like <hi>Promotheus,</hi> ſeated indeed on high, but miſerably vexed at the heart, and inwardly gnawed with a devouring plague: And yet it is ſeen, that as the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in an extravagant ſit ſpeaketh things agreeing with the humour of ambitious men, having once extolled them, they glory as much in their reproach and ſhame. This then is the beſt of their time; upon this empty Air is the whole dependance of their joy: And how apt this wind is to turn, who doth not perceive? Nay, who knoweth not that it cannot long blow
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:95462:130"/> from that Point? And as the ſporting <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins,</hi> dancing in their liquid Field, poſſeſs with grateful delights men unacquainted with the certainty of an approaching Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt; ſo do the Gratulatory Songs of the peoples affections, when Rebels come to the Stern, and ſail in the Seas of Dominion, much pleaſe theſe Novices in Government; but preſently follow the rough Storms of Obloquy, heightned with loud threats, and clamorous complaints; which make that place, which at firſt ſeemed the moſt pleaſing, to appear the moſt dangerous and horrid of all that worldly miſery ever poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed. So doth this preceding glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come no other than the neareſt way to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured infamy, and the contempt is the greater, when it falleth upon men ſometime overladen with undue honours. And what ridiculous Toys, what odious things <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> maketh ſuch her once admired ones, is lately ſhewn, when thoſe, to whom it gave the moſt Honourable Titles of the <hi>Supreme Head,</hi> and the <hi>Supreme Authority,</hi> the people transformed after the ſtrangeſt manner, thinking the name of the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſightly and unclean part of the body moſt ſuitable to them, no taunt, or ſcoff, being thought ſufficient for their demerits. Their
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:95462:131"/> affairs, when they hope for the beſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently turn to the worſt, all ſtill happening otherwiſe than they hope; and then; with the <hi>Devil,</hi> they think themſelves <hi>tormented before their time.</hi> Indeed their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences will not give them leave to ſleep in the Beds of ſecurity, but <hi>Gods Juſtice</hi> letteth them not be long in ſafety. They alway expect the ſtroak thereof; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may by forſaking their ſins prevent it, yet will they not, but rather provoke and haſten it. <hi>God</hi> likewiſe ſeeing their obdurate continuance in wickedneſs, is the more ſpeedy in performance of his word, whereby he hath made his ſervants to hope, which is, that <hi>bloudy and deceitful men ſhall not live out half their days:</hi> He remembreth and ſuccoureth his Children, <hi>breaking the Rod of their Oppreſſor, and bringing thoſe to confuſion who hate them.</hi> Thus while they behold to days proſperity, not forecaſting future accidents and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and putting as far from them as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they can the thoughts of account to be given to him, who is, as in Glory, ſo in Power exalted above them: They are as a Ship ſwallowed up by the Quick-ſands, with only a Maſts top appearing uſeful to all that paſs by, although it ſelf utterly
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:95462:131"/> periſhing. It warneth them to avoid that dangerous Road, where is nothing to be expected but mercileſs deſtruction, and to provide for their welfare by a better Courſe.</p>

               <p>Good <hi>God,</hi> how little is thy Wrath feared? How regardleſs are miſerable men of thy diſpleaſure, when no examples of ſeverity will admoniſh them? <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day;</hi> yet others <hi>will not underſtand, or be wiſe.</hi> How many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies have our late days ſeen diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and (by the bleſſing of God) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded? We cannot boaſt of a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in his ſight deſerving it, but <hi>God was angry with the wicked.</hi> Rebellion and Stubbornneſs are before him ſuch abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſins, that if we conſider the multitude of miſcarriages, the ſufferings of many, and the impenitency of others pardoned, we might be much of the fear (did we not know <hi>God</hi> infinitely gracious, and proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he <hi>willeth not the death of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>) that they exclude Mercy. Many who have been active, and ſince pardoned, have been incouraging themſelves, and their
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:95462:132"/> language, tending to the diſheartening of his Majeſties Friends, and incouragement of Forreign Enemies: And theſe would not learn, from other men their Leaders, what muſt be their merited portion. Thoſe Enemies to Peace, and themſelves, who will not accept a ſmall reproof mixt with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant favours, are deſervedly brought under the Wheel; for what doth more ſuit with the contempt of Mercy, than ſeverity and vengeance?</p>
               <p>SOME there are who would ſeem ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably well affected to the <hi>Royal Cauſe,</hi> whileſt frequent in rehearſals of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted Crimes. Who ſo glorieth in his ſin, doth ſo often react it as he boaſtingly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth it: which is a thing too too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among multitudes concerned in the <hi>Act of Pardon.</hi> Surely it teſtifieth the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all holy ſorrow conceived for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Diſloyalties, and (if I may inoffenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak my thoughts) argueth a readineſs, upon occaſion, to act over again what they love to repeat. <hi>God</hi> calleth for mourning and ſorrow, that pious tears may waſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſtains of Innocent and Loyal Blood; without which, a <hi>good man</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, the moſt juſt <hi>Judge</hi> will by no means acquit or indemnifie. For want of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:95462:132"/> theſe, <hi>Gods</hi> provoked anger may (if his mercies prevent not) render the whole Land a confuſed Maſs of Calamity over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with a juſt overthrow. <hi>Blood it defileth the Land:</hi> The defilement hath not been ordinary, but ſuperabundant; the Streets of moſt Towns and Cities, the Fields and Highways complain even yet of the injurious burthen, and cry for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance unto him, who will undoubtedly Judge in Truth and Equity. Pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Repentance will (and nothing elſe) remove the burthen, and ſtop the cry. If his diſtinguiſhing compaſſion ſpare others, yet the guilty and obſtinate muſt by their puniſhment purge away the defilement: For before either Sorrow or Judgement purge the Land, we cannot well expect that our <hi>God can be favourable and gracious unto Sion.</hi> Conſider we the overthrow of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar. God,</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> threatned the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood which <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> ſhed: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi> had ſhed much, but was repentant: yet we find the wrath of <hi>God</hi> pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Judah,</hi> even after <hi>Manaſſeh</hi>'s death, for that Blood which he had ſhed. But <hi>God</hi> doth not puniſh a <hi>Nation</hi> for one mans ſins,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:95462:133"/> and he penitent; he is juſt, and maketh every one bear his own burden; neither will he judge them, who impartially judge and condemn themſelves: But <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) had many Inſtruments in ſuch Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Facts, who repented not. His Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance might procure his own deliverance, but was no way beneficial to others, who being <hi>guilty of blood</hi> (and peradventure not barely Inſtruments, but Promoters of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) ſought not by Contrition to pacifie the incenſed <hi>Avenger.</hi> There is no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge appointed for ſinners, eſpecially thoſe ſtained with blood: And if the <hi>Avenger</hi> overtake him that ſhed it before he eſcape thither, there is no favour, no mercy to be ſhewn. The Innocent Blood which ſome have ſhed (all that ever bare Arms againſt their <hi>King</hi>) muſt either be waſhed away with tears by all the Offenders and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or will be by their blood. I ought to think that ſome of theſe have by their happy ſorrows quitted themſelves of their Crimſon miſeries, and have obtained thoſe propitiatory drops which make Blood-guiltineſs diſappear as if it had never been. But yet we ſee how impenitency driveth many upon preſumptuous attempts, which muſt unſheath <hi>the Sword of Juſtice,</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:95462:133"/> blood from them, from whom tendred mercy could draw no tears; and how o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mock at their own calamity by vain-glorious boaſtings, of what temperate men would account their greateſt ſhame, and bluſh at the rehearſal. Theſe men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not the <hi>Manaſſeh</hi>'s who marched in the Heads of <hi>the blood-thirſty Regiments,</hi> are equally culpable with their Leaders, by the barbarous execution of their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and mercileſs Commands: And if Vengeance ſtrike the Head, making it bear its ſhame, the members are partakers with it, and cannot but undergo the infamy. See we how mans iniquity wearieth him in the ſearch after Juſtice, and the purſuit of its reward.

Hoping them to be found rather ignorant than malicious, he was ready to forgive, upon this account, that <hi>they knew not what they did.</hi> But <hi>Villany</hi>

It diſdaineth a curb, and he who would ſtifle it, giveth it the advantage to be made more apparent; he that would conceale it, maketh it better known. The ſinner is a blind <hi>Sentinel,</hi> he ſtandeth much upon his Guards; but while he would not have ſuch as he hath made his Adverſaries to obſerve his defects, his ill poſtures of body directed the contrary way, ſummon all to a nearer approach, and to take their fill of both revenge and ſcorn. <hi>Rebellion</hi> not repented of thus, bringeth to confuſion and ſhame the wretched Actors. If not at firſt known, it ſoon betrayeth it ſelf; if known, and not pun ſhed, it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all its own Engines to its own over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw: Ruine is the end it aſpireth to a d it is indefatigable until that is obtained. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THIS being the nature of the ſin, the general miſcarriages of Rebellious under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings cannot be thought ſtrange. Such as the counſels are, ſuch muſt be the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; from whence they had a being they return in the end. The ſtratagems of the moſt ſubtle and cruel enemy of man are undiſcerned by both the ambitious and malitious. He ſmootheth over his bait with a delicate gloſs and fair appearance but his cruelty at laſt maketh even for all. The uncertain appearance of the promiſed good was never ſo pleaſing as the certain evil proveth terribly diſtracting. But ſome men how far are they from ſhame or compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon themſelves, not remembring that the counſels of the <hi>infernal foe,</hi> though they raiſe the hopes to promotion, never miſs of bringing the abuſed Clients to deſtruction! Examples being the ſureſt way of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let us look abroad, and after ſearch of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity ſee how many of its upſtart prodigies of honor died in peaceable poſſeſſion of it, and came to their graves <hi>Sicca morte.</hi> But ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of our homebred conſpirators being
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:95462:135"/> more uſeful (eſpecially ſuch as are freſh in our memories) we may obſerve that ſuch wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs cannot be long proſperous. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings of this nature are weighty, one counſel ſtill depreſſing another when all things ſeem to have attained perfection. And this, that <hi>God</hi> may ſhew himſelf juſt and wiſe, who taketh the wiſe in their craftineſs and diſappointeth the inventions of the wicked. I have already ſpoken of the moſt <hi>execrable Regicides,</hi> whoſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings I gladly mention, although it greiveth me to remember the cauſe. But conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sir John Hotham</hi> the firſt profeſſed <hi>rebel,</hi> whoſe <hi>treaſon</hi> at <hi>Hull</hi> found a ſuitable <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> I think that no faithleſs ſubject was ever more exactly fitted by <hi>kind Maſters</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying my words in the former Chapter, <hi>That the firſt aſſiſtance in Treaſonable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have many times the Fortune to be the firſt taſters of the mercileſs power of ſuch as imployed them.</hi> We may ſee in the actions of traytors what they think to be the juſt recompence of their falſhood, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly judge of their miſery, who by their own opinion pre-condemn themſelves. And eaſily may we diſcern what kind of happineſs theſe men have, who are not ſafe one among another. If judgement
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:95462:135"/> faileth to come upon them from elſewhere, it is uſual to have <hi>fire come out from</hi> Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech <hi>and devour the men of</hi> Sechem <hi>and the houſe of</hi> Millo, <hi>and to come out from the men of</hi> Sechem <hi>and the houſe of</hi> Millo <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> Abimelech. Such was the miſerable end of that treacherous Knight his complices in iniquity being (it is uncertain whether) as juſt towards him, as he, and they unjuſt and ungrateful toward their moſt kind and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral <hi>Maſter.</hi> Enmity it ſelf could not have invented a more proper revenge for ſuch a crime; nor of all examples can there (in my judgement) be found one more expreſly teaching us the evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of infidelity. Hear we <hi>that bleſſed King,</hi> whom he had ſo impudently affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, compaſſionately delivering his thoughts of it; <hi>Poor Gentleman</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he is now become a notable monument of unproſperous diſloyalty, teaching the World by ſo ſad and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate a ſpectacle, that the rude carriage of a ſubject towards his Sovereign carrieth alway its own vengeance with it as an inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhadow.</hi> He truely knew how to pity and ſhewed by him what others might beſt expect. He would have had warning ſo taken by him, as that poſterity might ſee no more ſuch examples, nor have occaſion
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:95462:136"/> to relate the mournful paſſages of men for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaken by grace and fortune. For ſuch muſt needs be calamitous appropriating and engroſſing to themſelves the threatned curſe, that <hi>becauſe they regard not the work of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands, he ſhall deſtroy them and not build them up.</hi> As one hunting a poor fugitive hare rideth after the chaſe through a deceitful land un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined and by reaſon of many pits very perillous; ſo is he who unlawfully purſueth honor and dominion; the prey taken can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not compenſate the danger or make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for his fears; But there is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of taking what he ſeeketh accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a certainty of periſhing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be obtained or loſt. The worſt things deareſt bought are the contentments of fools: Religion, reputation, liberty and peace, nay even all the goods of body and ſoul do they paſs away in exchange for an unſeen glory and a projected proſperity, and will not be guided by <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> nor in the leaſt own her, until <hi>ſhe laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear is come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is a moſt excellent decree of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> that ſin ſhould either not be proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, or proſper to its own ruin. As
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:95462:136"/> 
                  <hi>Nature</hi> inſtructeth us in things <hi>Monſtrous,</hi> that they never generate, or things of a <hi>Viperous kind,</hi> which although they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, yet bring forth at once their Fruit and Death; ſo obſervation in paſſages of <hi>Providence</hi> will teach us, that wickedneſs either hath no procedure, or an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate one. Evil counſels commonly vaniſh into nothing, and the <hi>Authors</hi> vex at their hopes, proving fruitleſs Dreams: But if (as it ſometimes happeneth) they raiſe the <hi>Authors</hi> to a Throne of Sublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet have they no enjoyment of theſe ſucceſſes; for the very ſucceſſes are the moſt certain and killing miſchiefs. More than the <hi>the Viperous Race</hi> do ſuch proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities not only deſtroy them of whom they had a being, but hinder Generation in thoſe minds, which being otherwiſe apt, are by fear diſabled. <hi>Rebellion</hi> (too too common notwithſtanding) would more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly multiply its curſed Off ſpring, did not the haſty diſpatches of the Divine Wrath overthrow thoſe Mountains of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, which proud men having raiſed to themſelves, do conceive immoveable. Some whoſe inclinations are not averſe to baſe undertakings, do ſomewhat forbear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (being not ſo wholly void of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:95462:137"/> as others) they ſee the danger, and will not ingage. But where the want of judgment taketh away fear, men are active to their hurt; for ſo it alway proveth, there being no ſolid hopes of an happy end without a good beginning. Would any one, who knew the danger, plunge himſelf all over head and body in a boiling Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace? or leap down a ſteep Rock into a devouring Gulph? Neither can any man of a ſober mind caſt himſelf off from the ſecure <hi>Rock of Loyalty,</hi> into the <hi>Whirlpool of Diſobedience.</hi> He ſeeth no cauſe, no profit, no honour, not the leaſt, either convenience or neceſſity, to perſwade him to any ſuch thing. He well eſteemeth it the abjection of himſelf, and in the beſt ſtate of Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Diſloyalty, ſeeth nothing tempting him to the experiment of the worſt. And ſome, who in contempt of <hi>God</hi> would even dare to ſin, are reſtrained by the continual miſcarriages, either early or later, of ſuch as <hi>Humane Vengeance,</hi> by the appointment of the <hi>Divine,</hi> hath taken away from the midſt of the Earth at times, when they leaſt expected evil, and moſt preſumed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the goodneſs of their Fortune. Theſe (although ſcarce other than blind) diſcern how ſhort a bleſſing <hi>Fortune</hi> conferreth
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:95462:137"/> upon ſuch undeſerving ſervants; and that ſhe flieth from them with more ſpeed than <hi>the Sun,</hi> from his Riſing to his Setting: From ſuch ſhe commonly maketh an unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual haſt, making her Morning come late, and her Evening ſoon; then leaving them to the darkneſs of their guilty minds, but the open puniſhment of their odious acts. The miſeries and juſt ſufferings of theſe are uſeful to others, I wiſh I could ſay to all: But <hi>God,</hi> who maketh other mens evils to become his Childrens good, hath not been pleaſed to grant them ſo full a favour, as to bring into their Sacred Society all thoſe who have forſaken the Paths of Life, to tread the Ways of Darkneſs, whom he hath yet ſpared, that they may repent, and not poſt forward to Judgment by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe obſtinacy in what he abhorreth, and will ſorely puniſh with preſent and eternal Plagues.</p>
               <p>THEY who have had ſuch Motives to Humility, ſhould adviſedly repair to their Offices and Duties of Allegiance, certify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves of the rigour of provoked patience, when turned into fury. Why will they multiply thoſe tranſgreſſions, whereof the leaſt is in <hi>Gods</hi> ſight mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous? Can they eſteem that light, which
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:95462:138"/> 
                  <hi>God</hi> ſo remarakably puniſheth above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins?

When <hi>Kings,</hi> who are <hi>her Nurſing Fathers,</hi> are ſpurned at, and inſulted over by the foot of Pride, there can be no <hi>Peace in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity within her Palaces.</hi> And it is indeed too well known, that Rebels ſpare no part of the <hi>Body,</hi> when they can give Law to the <hi>Head;</hi> and that they never ſeek to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the <hi>Guardian,</hi> unleſs their Luſt covet the <hi>Churches</hi> defilement.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:95462:138"/> are alway fighting againſt them, as well as their own ſins, againſt which their ſubtilty can never prevail. Although they ſtrive, and with continued labours endeavour to get ſome advantage, the profit of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours will be ſummed up in a <hi>Cypher,</hi> but their loſſes muſt needs riſe to an infinite ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:95462:140"/> abuſive provocations, be ſtill whetting and ſharpning them, and alway jeſting with them, until they receive the fatal ſtroak: And latter Executions revive and renew the remembrance of former Acts of Juſtice. Which good men conſider with compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate affections, bemoaning their wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whoſe hearts nothing could mollifie, but by devout joy expreſſing their grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to their <hi>Redeemer,</hi> who exalteth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency to a Throne, and dejecteth Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to a Dunghill. <hi>Gods</hi> Patience indeed is admirable; he waiteth long expecting mans change, and the Renovation of his mind: But without ſatisfaction, Patience muſt at length give up its place to Wrath. Sin moveth Heaven it ſelf to compaſſion, but Impenitency rejecteth it, as the Rock doth the Showres, which elſewhere are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and ſoftning. Continuance in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion muſt needs repeal the greateſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of Grace; and obdurate hearts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in cruelty only, ſhall aſſuredly have their fill of implacable ſeverity.</p>
               <p>WHEN it cometh to this, uſeleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is cheap and common: Then men wiſh that they had been provident, when they cannot regain their loſſes. He, who before his entry upon his deſperate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:95462:141"/> ſhould have propoſed this to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <hi>How dareſt thou adventure to croſs theſe Seas without fear, wherein ſo many have periſhed, nay, wherein is certainty of being wracked?</hi> never conſidereth the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, till he findeth his bottom ſplit, and the Flouds opening to receive him. Action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſultation, is faithfully attended with croſſes: It hath no Guide, neither ſeeketh to avoid them; in which reſpect it cannot but fall into misfortunes. Not to be willing to foreſee, is to reſolve to ſuffer, and to manage affairs unadviſedly, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine their miſcarriage: But when the certainty of the danger preſenteth it ſelf e're he begin, that perſon tempteth miſchief and ruine, who will preſumptuouſly go on. And truly ſuch an ones condition is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly not pitied when he complaineth, who when faithfully forewarned, would dare what wiſe men dread, who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the conſequences, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed himſelf, becoming his Enemies Slave by his own baſe ſurrender of himſelf. Man may not think to make his will his protection. By following the Counſel and Will of <hi>God,</hi> he may be ſure to proſper; for that Will is the only Rule of Safety. To go contrariwiſe, and be ſurprized by
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:95462:141"/> unhappy events is but what is common and unavoidable. Yet as if it were ſome unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted novelity which hapned unto them, men overtaken by their own deſert then begin to conſider and bewail their overſeeming fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when 'tis altogether too late. When the thoughts of their diſgraceful undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings perplex their minds, and the evil of adverſity pincheth and tormenth their body, then they confeſs what the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knew, that folly directed them and madneſs carrieth them on headlong to the unlucky ſtate, at which they are arrived. Temporal calamities make them confeſs their indiſcretion; under them they are ſorrowful, but moſt commonly it is rather becauſe they ſuffer what they deſired to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict on others, then out of a pious grief for their offences. That they are diſappointed of their beloved miſcheif is the matter of their grief. Their aſpiring thoughts and lofty aims brought down to ſhame, cauſe them bitterly to mourn; when alas! they ought firſt to have weighed the lawfulneſſe of their deſires, and then the probability of ſucceſs. But of the miſery of the ſoul which they long lay under, they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inſenſible. Thoſe ſtupifying bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of diſobedience they willingly bare,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:95462:142"/> and the Aſſes backs being broken, are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorry they can bear no longer. Surely, the afflictions of a ſtained conſcience are the moſt intollerable; It is ſtrange that he who can patiently abide them, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly endure the diſappointments and falſities of <hi>Fortune.</hi> Her injuries are nothing in compariſon of the inſulting Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies of ſin. Neither would any know what the miſeries of body meant, if the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of ſin had not firſt overladen them with its yoke. All things which afflict us are ſin contracted maladies, from which the beſt cannot glory in an immunity. But the difference between religious and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly men is, that thoſe with all their might and diligence ſhun the evil of ſin out of an holy hatred thereof, theſe as furiouſly fly from virtue, and with equal violence purſue what the others fear. In whom mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries muſt have the more perfect encreaſe, becauſe ſin the greater growth. Miſeries indeed are not in them preſently accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, partly becauſe their great ſins do not preſently gather into a body, and partly becauſe the greateſt evils, have the longeſt time e're they are formed and come to the birth. As many (and thoſe moſt incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) diſeaſes do not ſhew themſelves till
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:95462:142"/> by a long confluxion of peccant humors they have gotten ſtrength enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that body in which they reſide: ſo many calamities, which are the juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>God,</hi> and are daily nouriſhed by ſinful acts and deſires, have not a being as ſoon as the ſins, (for the birth muſt be younger then the parent) but after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time break, forth as being then mature and able for their deſigned employment. But now if a delight in ſin arm them not with a wounding and killing power, the harms of temporal croſſes are not matter of dread, nor other then ſuch as men bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine to be harms. Where the guilt and horrors of a polluted mind make them not hurtful, adverſities are but ſtingleſs ſerpents, which will not hurt us, if we fear not the name, but we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and play with them. To ſuch as have wilfully broken the commandement, <hi>God</hi> ſendeth them as offenſive tokens of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to thwart the unjuſt men in their wayes. He will not ſuffer them to reap the joys of the ſeed they have ſown; but as he ſendeth ſometimes ſhowres and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable flouds upon the Huſbandmans labours, preſently after he hath intruſted the prepared Soyl with the pledges of his
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:95462:143"/> hopes; or at other times with continual droppings, and overflowings at Harveſt, maketh his ſuppoſed rich return, to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into an impoveriſhing dearth: So ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Bud, ſometimes in the full Ear, when almoſt ripened, he deſtroyeth the Rebels confidence, by the ſecret diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his anger, or the open flouds of a ſweeping Vengeance. Mans condition here will not allow him an alway undiſturbed felicity; but Rebellion permitteth not that little time of repoſe, which they were otherwiſe capable of, to fall into the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> Lot. And then by the benefit of a quieted Conſcience, the caſualties of life are to good men void of trouble, but to ungodly men they are irkſome, and intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; they groan and repine under them: Which reſtleſneſs is not given by outward trouble, but by inward guilt, Conſcience aggravating, nay making it grief. That therefore men may the better bear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ones, and not incur extraordinary troubles; or if they ſhould happen, that they may not make them miſerable, let them free themſelves from guilt, and by obedience put themſelves under the defence of the <hi>Almighty.

               <p>SUCH is the turbulency and unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tledneſs of Humane Diſpoſitions, that men are commonly diſpleaſed with what their Fathers prized, and not well affected to their own former pleaſures. Mens minds are ſeldom at reſt but in alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and change: Which although it pleaſe the Fancy, yet I ſee not where it leaveth place for Content; without which, I wonder at thoſe who can imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy, and well. Mens falſe ſight loveth not what is beſt, but what is new, in the ſeeking whereof is all the pleaſure: For while its novelty perſwadeth, and the ſearch taketh up time, it becometh ſtale as ſoon as obtained, and the thoughts are taken off from the joy of poſſeſſion, by the renewed deſires of ſome other Upſtart, and untryed good. In ſuch varying motions men love to paſs their time, and are no otherwiſe eaſie than in this continual unquietneſs. The reaſon of this the <hi>Tragedian</hi> hath:

                  </q> Proſperity maketh many men mad. Such as have more than they can wiſely manage, deſpiſe what they enjoy, and make their Pleaſures abortive by unſeaſonable long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Continuance of what is good ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiteth the minds of many who might have been long happy, if they had known con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. But, alas! it is a Diſeaſe which creepeth in with Peace and Plenty, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and deſtroy them; that contentment is leaſt known, where there is greateſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of what Mortals account the chief Ingredients, and Compounds of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. Where there is more than enough, there is commonly leaſt ſatisfaction, and moſt inordinate deſires. But herein would not be ſo much cauſe of diſlike, if men did not ſo diſtaſt their preſent happineſs, as to undervalue it, by making it the purchaſe of ſome certain grief. The favour of the Greateſt, heaps of Wealth, multiplicity of Honours, and whatever elſe is moſt prized by the admirers of terrene flouriſhes, and fading Beauties, have by many (who once
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:95462:147"/> thought theſe the only things deſirable) been judged things ſo inconſiderable, that theſe, together with their lives, they have adventured for ſome conceited good, which few others could view with approbation, but moſt with amazement at the Seekers do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: Of which I truly am one confeſſing, that I never thought any ſo mad as thoſe whom I have ſeen raiſed very high by Proſperity, who (as if unable to brook that height) have with brain-ſick counſels hurled themſelves down. It is uſual with men lifted up beyond what their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will bear, by endeavours to leap higher for more ſafety, to fall paſt recovery. Neither is it news to any, but thoſe who are diſtracted with the manifold blandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a bewitching Fortune. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is no new thing to ſee men adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to climb ſo far, that when they muſt come down, there is no deſcent but by a Precipice. With examples of this nature the world is ſtored; and if freſh ones ſpeak not more than can my Pen, I might be induced to enlarge upon this Subject. What I have ſeen maketh me ſad, and many to complain; and both the paſt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent damages which we have and do ſuſtain by the madneſs of ſuch as might be at eaſe,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:95462:148"/> but would not, make me fear further evil, and cry out.</p>

The <hi>inconſtancies</hi> of the Elder would not encourage the Younger to be diſſolute, if <hi>Conſtancy</hi> were thought either a <hi>Virtue,</hi> or uſeful.

They will without judgment pry into the <hi>Royal Counſels,</hi> and while they are only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:95462:149"/> of the intentions, do openly calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate the actions of their compaſſionate and tender <hi>Father,</hi> with his great and wiſe <hi>Miniſters of State.</hi> Peace and reſt diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth them, and they are never more que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous, than when they have leaſt cauſe: Contradicting all reaſon, and deſirous to deſtroy their preſent tranquility, the <hi>Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> days are recalled, and they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make <hi>brick with ſtubble,</hi> than live mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily at their own pleaſure without fear, and plentifully, as well as eaſily, by a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of fructifying gratitude. Thus was <hi>Peace</hi> diſeſteemed, although no worldly bleſſing more deſirable; whoſe glory and beauty are the more raviſhing, becauſe ſhe is ſo like and near of Kin to that gladding <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> which for ever maketh happy the Royal Subjects of the <hi>King of Kings.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, her Graces and Endowments prevail not with the greater number of men, for either welcome, or reſpect. And what between her Relation to Heaven, and the publick ſcorns whereby ſhe ſuffereth, ſhe is rather deſired by good men, than known to many. Where ſhe ſometimes ſheweth her fair countenance, ſhe is ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely perſecuted with the foul provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:95462:149"/> of wicked men, that ſhe ſoon begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to mourn; and covering thoſe radiant looks with a fable vail, to withdraw her ſelf from humane habitations. Although ſhe be a rare Gueſt, and come but ſeldom, ſhe is aſſured of injuries. She ſeeketh to make glad all among whom ſhe is; and whether to her true or adopted Children no Mother equalleth her Benedictions, ſhe ſurpaſſeth them all in Munificence: Her kindneſs is incomparable, and thoſe who receive her, ſhe gladly enricheth: Yet they, to whom ſhe hath been moſt liberal, are uſually the firſt who repay her favours with indignities. For whereas the mercies of Peace require a ſanctified life, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of devout thankfulneſs, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more common than to make uſe of the bleſſings of Peace, in ſuch a manner as ſhall ſooneſt cauſe her departure and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Our <hi>Land</hi> had not long known what it was to be at reſt, e're the wanton Inhabitants, by undue and irreligious mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings, ſought to caſt out the <hi>Mother,</hi> and the true <hi>Children; Peace,</hi> and ſuch as were conſtantly hers, whoſe daily practiſe it was to praiſe <hi>God</hi> for her preſence, and humbly entreat him for her ſtay among us. The diſreſpect of the benefit maketh <hi>God</hi> again
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:95462:150"/> remove it. Forreign Enemies take occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to diſcover their enmity, and make a breach with us, hoping to make a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous War by our diviſions at home Our own inconſtancy then fought againſt us, and our folly armed thoſe who ſought our ruine. But <hi>Gods</hi> mercies were not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the multitudes vanity. Although the unquietneſs of our raving minds plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt us he had pity upon us; and not ſuffering our Foes to rejoyce over us, hath remitted that graceful and amiable <hi>Preſervatrix</hi> of the <hi>Kingdomes</hi> Honour and Fortunes, whereby we with it may alway flouriſh; and may men of all eſtates labour her preſervation, wherein all mens good conſiſteth. Nothing but ingratitude can make us vile, with which a <hi>Nation</hi> abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, falleth into the loweſt degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and is buried in ſcorn and infamy.</p>
               <p>THE diſreſpective murmurings of the preſent times begin to affright ſuch as are in love with <hi>Peace,</hi> and cannot contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brook a ſeparation from her. We hear language contrary to what we pray for, and <hi>God</hi> expecteth, as if a ſurfeit of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, upon ſo ſhort an enjoyment, had made the Speakers belch out theſe unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Airs. But ſurely they, who would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:95462:150"/> their condition by thus loathing the Preſent, do mar thoſe undeſerved bleſſings wherewith ſacred Bounty hath ſtored them. They, who have been alway wont to vex at their preſent eſtate, muſt have a great change of diſpoſition to bring them to fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. Continual complaints make nothing better. The unrulineſs of a people is its own Scourge. And as diſquieted minds are wont to be followed with outward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſo are there none more miſerable then they, who know not when to rejoyce, who, when a juſt cauſe exciteth them to it, cannot diſcern it. The trouble of their inconſtancy and ignorant contempt of what is good and deſirable maketh them wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; even when nothing is wanting to the compleating their happineſs. But the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, which diſcompoſe proſperity, making good bad, do ſtill go on to make bad worſe, that ſuch as reproach mercie may deſervedly never be exempt from the croſſes of either their own opinion or fortune. If ſo be nevertheleſs the bleſſings are not ſo abſolutely full of what I judge neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the work of my joy, before I find fault I muſt conſider whether I judge aright, or whether that which is wanting to my joy, be not more abundantly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:95462:151"/> by a greater good to others, or elſe, if I ſhould undervalue the preſent bleſſing, whether I am ſure of a better, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining to amend not impair my preſent condition and fortune. No man is the more happy in being ſelf-willed, envious or raſh. Moſt men, who ſhew themſelves publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vexed at the miſcarriages of the times, are either envious, or ambitious, or blind followers of ſuch dark-ſighted guides. They are either diſquieted with their own fooliſh hopes and feares, or other mens troubleſome counſels, and not judgeing a right whether they have a cauſe to be troubled, madly act to the overthrow of peace, whereby they afflict all, and better not, but rather involve themſelves in the greateſt calamities. For ſurely no benefit can a crew to the unconſtant and waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, who would be happy but hateth the meanes. Except we be at unity among our ſelves, we cannot be proſperous. This Unity is <hi>Ointment</hi> which <hi>covering the Head and running down to the skirts</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Prince</hi> glorious and the <hi>Subject</hi> happy; for where it is <hi>there the Lord hath commanded the bleſſing.</hi> It is an Oracle from <hi>the moſt Holy One, In return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reſt ſhall ye be ſaved,</hi>

Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of perplexing thoughts and contrary motions never finde it. He, who ſeeketh it every where, ſhall find it no where, for indeed a reſtleſs life hath no agreement with it. Although it wholly ſpend it ſelf in purſuing it, yet it continually affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that fortune, which it ſo laboriouſly courteth. When the froward man is neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to it, he is furtheſt from enjoyment of it, becauſe happineſs is onely the humble, the peaceable, and (to ſay all) the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent mans portion. It is true that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient turbulent man may ſeem to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it. And if you ask the ignorant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded multitude, they ſhall aſſure you, that although it be ill procured, the happineſs of many ſuch is not to be diſputed. But thou whoſoever, that boaſteſt of thy ſelf according to their meaſures or noiſe, art but an equivocating fool, and moſt indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to thine own adverſity.

                  <hi>non mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationibus inquietaris</hi> &amp;c. But yet it is very ſeldome that diſobedience is ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate as to purchaſe an eſteem of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. True happineſs it never hath, rarely ſo much as a ſuppoſed one. It runneth into diſtreſs continually, and hath no moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but downward. It is in the condition of many languiſhing perſons, who think by raiſing themſelves out of their ſick bed the ſooner to recover ſtrength, but indeed caſt themſelves down paſt hopes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Such is the unquiet ſubject; he is pained at the heart and caſt down by the multitude of his vain imaginations; theſe having caſt him down urge the raiſing himſelf up and providing better for the future. But what he ſurmiſeth will be for his advancement and confirmation fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not of proving his deſtruction. Now where there is in a Commonwealth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what out of that excellent order, which good men deſire to be diligently and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:95462:152"/> kept, diſorderly motion doth much hurt in introducing confuſion to cure a ſmall overſight The hunting after and uſing variety of medicines doth commonly more diſtemper the body than the diſeaſe it ſelf. When it happeneth that good order is in ſome things wanting, we can find no certain remedy obvious but pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. How much more then doth it not concern us to run after deſperate remedies for the curing diſtempers, which are only imaginary? If ſuſpitions upon probable grounds ſhould preſent themſelves, they are to be rejected; neither may we, if truth ſhould manifeſt a miſcarriage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for a removal otherwiſe then by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſubmiſſive holineſs. But I may ſay that obſerving the complaints of late days concerning certain publick adminiſtrations in the Kingdome, that fear and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are our greateſt miſcheifes. The times of darkneſs have had ſo long and potent dominion over ſome, that although it be now clear day, they cannot ſee the right path, but run out of the way and ſtumble at every thing. But happineſs offereth it ſelf to ſuch as will embrace it. If religious whiſperings are frequent and active for the begetting jealouſies and fears, a ſober and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:95462:153"/> religious man troubleth not his thoughts with the conſideration of other mens du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but laboureth not to be found for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of his own. And alway doth ſuch a man diſcover the moſt aſſured way to a bleſſed and happy eſtate by obedience for conſcience ſake. He remembreth <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> aſſeveration and delighteth in the hope it giveth; <hi>In the way of righteousneſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 12 28.</note> 
                  <hi>and in the path way thereof there is no death.</hi> Into that way then will he direct his foot ſteps, where he is ſure the <hi>Viper</hi> lurketh not to bite his <hi>heel,</hi> nor is the <hi>net</hi> privily ſpread to take his inoffenſive <hi>foot,</hi> neither can <hi>misfortunes</hi> lie neer in ambuſh to ſurprize his ſecure <hi>ſoul.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if we would all walk, we ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently obtain what with fruitleſs labours we are long ſeeking and wonder that we find not. Saint <hi>James</hi> his reaſon, to ſuch as did ask yet did not receive, is mine to thoſe, who ſeek felicity with great earneſtneſs, yet could never come within view of it, <hi>Ye have not becauſe ye ask</hi> and ſeek <hi>amiſs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ch. 4 3.</note> Endeavours directing us the right and proper way come to a bleſſed end. I know not, neither can I ever be perſwaded that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:95462:153"/> can have any other rule leading them to proſperity but religious obedience. That it is the onely way to eternal Felicity is agreed upon and acknowledged by them, who act the contrary. And I muſt needs follow them ſo cloſe as to affirm, that then by conſequence it is that onely which can conduce to the preſent well being of a <hi>Nation.</hi> For as no good can come elſewhere then from <hi>God,</hi> ſo no bleſſing can deſcend upon thoſe actions which have not his warrant. <hi>Obedience</hi> hath too motives urging us to its practiſe; the firſt, that it is a moſt plain and eaſie walk; the ſecond, that it hath moſt large promiſes and the beſt aſſurances, the very knowledge whereof doth (doubtleſs) make it more eaſie. It <hi>is the firſt,</hi> nay the only <hi>Commandement with promiſe,</hi> which we find in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> and is in none obſerved by <hi>God</hi> without very high eſteem and acceptance. And conſider with common reaſon, that as nothing can be eaſier then humility and ſubmiſſion, ſo nothing ſooner prevaileth for ſatisfaction in what it ſueth for. The moſt <hi>haughty ſpirits</hi> and <hi>furious Tyrants</hi> have been wont.
<q>—Cinere exceptos ſuper alta locare.</q>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:95462:154"/> And as for the mild man, who ſweetneth all his actions with clemency, nothing can be more offenſive to his compaſſionate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then to ſee humility paſs along irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced, much more to ſee it ſcorned and injured. But neither is this all; for it being that virtue, wherewith he is chiefly converſant, he will undoubtedly ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into his boſome ſuch as a conſtant exerciſe in the ſame virtue hath commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him. Likewiſe if affections plead a reward (and that no mean one) to be their due, and he cannot ſuffer them by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to be diſcouraged. It muſt then be a vanity and folly to travel far about after an uncertainty, and ſlight an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good within reach, which without care or fear is to be poſſeſſed. Such are the rewards of <hi>Religious Loyalty;</hi> it with great facility thriveth and proſpereth, and being exempt from fear doth eaſily keep its well gotten ſtore.

Their toyl alſo is very ridiculous, if more probably ſucceſsful, ſeeing eaſier means prevail for the greateſt goods.

               <p>LET us at the laſt rather then never begin to conſult what courſe of life <hi>God</hi> hath appointed as that wherein Subjects may live moſt ſecure.

No incenſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending with an odoriferous cloud, no

They who gave their bodies to be burnt, by the benefit hereof made their ſufferings thoſe <hi>harmleſs</hi> (though <hi>fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) Chariots,</hi> that tranſported them to joy. This ſharpened the faith of <hi>the general aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the firſt born,</hi> enabling them to ſee their names written in heaven. Holy men, knowing how much this was the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and felicity of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> ſound <hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Oratories,</hi> where joynt <hi>prayers</hi> ſhould be <hi>offered up for Kings and ſuch as were in authority, that under them we might be godly and quietly governed.</hi> And the unwearied exerciſe and profeſſion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wrought upon the hearts of the cruelleſt <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and introduced a feſtival peace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, making ſome of the moſt violent gain-ſayers ſubmit to men of ſo exalted ſpirits, and cheriſh ſuch as they before perſecuted. And certainly <hi>God</hi> ſpaketh how much he is pleaſed with it by
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:95462:158"/> the evident returns of acceptance, thoſe frequent collations of temporal honours and riches, wherewith he graceth ſuch as deſire to encreaſe by his Love only. And this purchaſe of liberty, wealth and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the cheapeſt, eaſieſt and ſureſt that Heaven and Earth afford. Others coſt much labour, and deficiency is at length their accompliſhment. Hence therefore is the excellence of <hi>Obedience</hi> commended, that it aſcendeth without rub, let, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation; it becometh great and glorious without noiſe, and without either the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors or any ones injury. It findeth joy at hand, and without the wearying exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the diverſity of opinions and manifold directions, where to ſeek mans <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> lodgeth it moſt ſafety at home. The <hi>Obedient mans</hi> well fortified heart hath joy therein immoveably fixt and and knoweth the worth of its own poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which by the Love of <hi>God</hi> it hath obtained and confirmed.

And among many moſt profitable rudiments, with which they are furniſhed as neceſſary for their ſafe conduct thither, theſe are ſome of the chief; That (ſeeing <hi>without holineſs no man can ſee God,</hi> (and therefore never be happy) which holineſs muſt not be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious, becauſe ſuch will not paſs the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of his dijudicative eye) it is a meer abjection of themſelves and hopes to attempt the raiſing themſelves high upon foundations of hypocriſie; That it is far better to live in eſteem by giving due honor to thoſe, whom <hi>God</hi> hath ſet over them, than to become infamous by ſeeking to inveſt themſelves with thoſe <hi>Robes,</hi> which adorning the <hi>Superior</hi> render the <hi>inferior</hi> the ridiculous object of contempt; That to aſſiſt the diſtreſſed
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:95462:159"/> and comfort them by timely ſupports is proper to a brave and noble <hi>Spirit,</hi> but to diſtreſs ſuch, whoſe welfare ſtanding in oppoſition to the accompliſhment of their exorbitant luſts, is degenerous and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh; That the approbation of <hi>the Supream Judge,</hi> and the real commendations of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency among <hi>men</hi> (although the bleſſed <hi>Authors</hi> ſit low) hath an excellency tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending the feigned title of the either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or unwilling multitude; That by the benefit of an unſpotted mind not to ſhun the examinations or fear the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the inquiſitive <hi>Judge</hi> bring them home a plentiful harveſt of joy, when onely horrors and confuſion multiply within thoſe breaſts, whoſe diſloyal pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes have rendred the faithful and wiſe <hi>Judge</hi> their juſtly provoked enemy; that to live frugally upon their own (that is bountifully without riot) and to purchaſe bleſſings upon it by the prayers of needy ſouls thereby refreſhed and made glad, hath a more plauſible triumph then to ſit on high in poſſeſſion of other men dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and eſtates, which alway bear to the wretched invaders the briars and thorns of misfortunes by reaſon of the complaints and curſes of the oppreſſed,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:95462:160"/> and are made barren by being water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the briniſh tears of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured mourners; That to ſail quietly and keep a ſafe courſe under that <hi>judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Maſter,</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> hath ſet over them hath benefit and content, whereas nothing but inevitable deſtruction attendeth thoſe deſperate Lovers of miſcheif, who labor contrary to the <hi>Maſters</hi> guidance to drive the bottom they ſail in upon rocks and ſhelves thereby to diſcredit and ruine him, who ſitteth at helm; Or elſe (and indeed that more properly) they eſteem their fare and proſperity to be good and large enough, nay mightily to abound while they ſit at home in the moſt ſecure <hi>harbor of Obedience,</hi> from whence they daily ſee the wracks of ſuch as lanch out into the troubleſome waters of <hi>Diſloyalty.</hi> And were there no more, yet to ſee ſuch mens misfortunes, while themſelves live in eaſe and ſafety, muſt needs give a vaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to the pleaſure of their mind. But how much more aſſuredly when they know that <hi>Chriſt</hi> their prime pattern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth them with exceeding delight, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for them an additional, a ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant joy? He doth indeed from his <hi>Throne</hi> behold them, intending no leſs then
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:95462:160"/> the deifying thoſe, who for his ſake do care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obey his glorious (though mortal) <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>This honor have all his Saints.</hi> He more then great <hi>Xerxes</hi> at the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laminian</hi> battle uſeth all diligence that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very act of <hi>Chriſtian Obedience,</hi> either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending <hi>the Royal Prerogative,</hi> or ſtoutly reſiſting the ſeducing temptations of its <hi>Oppoſers,</hi> be richly rewarded, and both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viteth and helpeth us to a lawrel. Thus with greater eaſe may we be happy then miſerable, and at cheaper rates gain not onely earthly but ſupernatural treaſures then many procure to themſelves preſent and eternal confuſion. Without over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning <hi>Order,</hi> diverting the courſe of <hi>Nature,</hi> ſearching the abyſſes of the earth, and ripping up its bowels, overthrowing <hi>walls and bulwarks,</hi> or defacing the glory of flouriſhing <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> thou, <hi>O Chriſtian Subject,</hi> mayeſt find and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace happineſs. <hi>Fear God, and Honor the King, thy work is done.</hi> This is the inchoation, and will be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted conſummation of Felicity. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>

                  <p>Let proſperity make us joyous, not mad and ſinful; for ſo ſhould we deſtroy our happineſs by forſaking thee the Author.</p>
                  <p>Great benefits haſt thou conferred upon us by the renewed and ſingular bleſſings of peace; O let not unconſtancy with calumnies and injurious complaints break down this pillar of our welfare, but make us with an holy thankfulneſs evermore to preſerve it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</p>
                  <p>Grant that we may alway be ſtanding upon our watch hearkening what thou, O Lord of life, doſt command, and eſpecially obſerving thoſe thy ſacred injunctions of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honor where honor is due, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace with all men.</p>
                  <p>They, who otherwiſe ſeek proſperity, do but trouble themſelves, for this is the way of life; hold thou our goings in this way, and keep us that our footſtept ſlip not, that there be no falling into decay by our treading aſide this path.</p>

                  <p>Help us with true meekneſs to receive thy word, and with perfect humility to obey thy commands, leſt evil get dominion over us and the great tranſgreſſions ſurprize us.</p>
                  <p>Then when our ear is ready to hear, and our will to obey, glory ſhall dwell in our land, the earth ſhall yeild her encreaſe, and thou, O God, ſhalt give us thy bleſſings.</p>
                  <p>Great peace have they, who Love thy Law, and nothing ſhall offend them; let the ſpirit of Love repleniſh us with holy deſires, that offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may ceaſe, and thy true religion flouriſh.</p>
                  <p>Happy are they, whom thou cauſeſt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto thee, whom Love and Obedience have made one with thee; they ſhall alway be praiſing thee with joyful lips.</p>
                  <p>Thou ſhalt keep them ſafely from the foot of pride, and in a pavilion from the ſtrife of tongues, thou ſhalt make them great through thy favour, and after a large por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Joy in this life ſhalt give them Joys, that paſs mans underſtanding.</p>
